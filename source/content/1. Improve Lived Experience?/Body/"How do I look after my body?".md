- Ok look so maybe I haven't solved this to the point where I'm super fit and lean and etc
- But I've spent hundreds of hours in the gym, I know what to do, etc
- My current fitness stack is:
	- Push/pull/legs split
	- Swimming
- And I'm really liking it!
- I swam regularly for around a month before then switching to weight training first, swimming straight after, and saw a huge improvement in my stamina/form â†’ I went from being exhausted after 4 laps, to being able to do ~40 laps without a break longer than ~5 seconds (the trick, like with running, is just to go slower, lol)
