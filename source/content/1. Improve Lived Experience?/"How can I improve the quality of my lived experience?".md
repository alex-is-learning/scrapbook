- **1 paragraph manifesto 2025-08-23** → There are things that I do which are silly and reduce the quality of my lived experience, e.g., rumination about my family. Doing a ridiculousness audit to create a simple log of these things that would clear up a lot of cognitive capacity per day if addressed would be very powerful. E.g., meditation to weaken/break the 4th and 5th fetters (craving and aversion), so that when a family member frustrates me, I notice "the gap" and don't habitually go into a thought spiral.
