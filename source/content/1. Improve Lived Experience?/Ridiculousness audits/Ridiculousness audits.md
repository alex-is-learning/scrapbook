## On ridiculousness audits
- I have this idea after reading the "The Mundanity of Excellence" paper
	- https://academics.hamilton.edu/documents/themundanityofexcellence.pdf
- "There's probably loads of things that I do, that more for lack of a better term 'elite' people, would look at and go 'dude, wtf, that's ridiculous'"
- This was part of my excitement re: applying to be an executive assistance to the CEO at Longview Philanthropy (I made it to the final final stage, it was between me and one other person, wah!) â†’ "I'll work closely with a CEO and a Chief of Staff and I'll get to exist in that new strata and see what they do differently from me"
