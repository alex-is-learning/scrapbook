- From my ridiculousness audit 
	- [[Ridiculousness audit 2025-08-23]]


---

- It's ridiculous that I used to have ~700 ==twitter== followers, and since my account got suspended (they thought I was a bot), I can't summon the energy to break free of my ~150 follower containment
- I have proved that I can gain followers organically. It took ages, but it's possible, and with my new account, a bunch of cool large-follower accounts have re-followed me, so that's great signal
#### Why the aversion to Twitter?
##### "I don't want to spend time on Twitter"
- Partly it's that I don't want to be reading tweets for more than like 5 mins a day
- I think twitter was really fun when I was having multiple back-and-forth interactions with various "tpot friends" daily, where we'd like each other's tweets and comment etc. Whereas I have a sense that I don't want to be hanging out there, I don't want to be reading other people's stuff much. So there's a feeling of "tweeting into the void", which of course feels worse
- ==Possible solution== → get over this "I don't want to read other people's tweets" thing. Perhaps only follow a handful of people, make friends with them, interact with them a bunch. Then it feels like more of a conversation again
##### "I don't need twitter → I have my group chat friends"
- I have a group chat with 2 friends and I'm much more likely to send stuff in there, "check out this thing I just wrote", "here's a photo of where I am right now", "here's a random thought", etc
- This feels better than tweeting (especially when you only have ~150 followers) because it's part of an ongoing conversation with friends
- But, it also doesn't cumulate! At the very least, I should endeavour to always tweet *too*, to get the best of both worlds
#### Why should I care about Twitter?
- It's full of great people who are aligned with me and who share my context (that is, stuff from the post-rationalist path)
- It's full of possible friends, teachers, mentors, collaborators. People to help and be helped by, people to hang out with, people to crew with, etc
