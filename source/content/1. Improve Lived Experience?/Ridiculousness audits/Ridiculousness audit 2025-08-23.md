- What is currently stressing me out, that I can change?
- What is currently ridiculous in my life

---
# 1. Actively stressing me out
- [[Skillful vs Unskillful Mind|Unskillful mind]] re: ruminating about my family all the time. (I've spent the last 1.5 weeks in a Spanish hospital helping my Dad, and he's been driving me mad, and on the drive to and from the hospital I think about how much he drives me mad, which is not very skillful at all)
- Not having a locked-in way to make money that feels safe

---
# 2. Not a source of stress, but silly when I think about it
- Stuff that, in the [[Ignoti nulla cupido]] way, isn't stressing me out because I'm used to it either never being a part of my experience, or I have given up on it being part of my experience, implicitly
## 2a. Not having a significant online platform
### Twitter
- It's ridiculous that I used to have ~700 ==twitter== followers, and since my account got suspended (they thought I was a bot), I can't summon the energy to break free of my ~150 follower containment
- I have proved that I can gain followers organically. It took ages, but it's possible, and with my new account, a bunch of cool large-follower accounts have re-followed me, so that's great signal
#### Why the aversion to Twitter?
##### "I don't want to spend time on Twitter"
- Partly it's that I don't want to be reading tweets for more than like 5 mins a day
- I think twitter was really fun when I was having multiple back-and-forth interactions with various "tpot friends" daily, where we'd like each other's tweets and comment etc. Whereas I have a sense that I don't want to be hanging out there, I don't want to be reading other people's stuff much. So there's a feeling of "tweeting into the void", which of course feels worse
- ==Possible solution== → get over this "I don't want to read other people's tweets" thing. Perhaps only follow a handful of people, make friends with them, interact with them a bunch. Then it feels like more of a conversation again
##### "I don't need twitter → I have my group chat friends"
- I have a group chat with 2 friends and I'm much more likely to send stuff in there, "check out this thing I just wrote", "here's a photo of where I am right now", "here's a random thought", etc
- This feels better than tweeting (especially when you only have ~150 followers) because it's part of an ongoing conversation with friends
- But, it also doesn't cumulate! At the very least, I should endeavour to always tweet *too*, to get the best of both worlds
#### Why should I care about Twitter?
- It's full of great people who are aligned with me and who share my context (that is, stuff from the post-rationalist path)
- It's full of possible friends, teachers, mentors, collaborators. People to help and be helped by, people to hang out with, people to crew with, etc
### Youtube
- It's ridiculous that I have the video editing skills/workflow & ability to be on camera etc and got to ~440 ==youtube== subscribers, and now I haven't posted in ~6 months and my subscriber count is gradually dwindling. I think there's definitely something here like "1 good quality video a week" = >5k subscribers within 12 months, which would be great for various reasons
#### Why have I let my Youtube channel languish?
- I was only one very specific version of myself on Youtube, the "I'm trying to be creative and make music, and I suck at it, but it's fun!" guy
- I think the overlap of youtube subscribers vs twitter followers would be two entirely non-overlapping circles, in a venn diagram
- So there's a sense of audience capture, where people on youtube know me as guy x, and to be like "actually x is just a tiny part of my experience" would be bad in some way. But on the other hand, fearing audience capture when you have ~400 subscribers is very silly, lol
- ==Solution== → just make a video about this, lol. A unifying video giving an overview of the various facets of my experience, various eras, etc. *Name* my embarrassment at going from "I'm gonna make a song a day!" to disappearing. Authenticity-maxx, basically
#### I don't want to encourage people to spend time on Youtube? 
- Youtube → there's something here around, it's like inspired by "Amusing Ourselves to Death" and also what DFW had to say about TV, and not wanting to create more "TV", more passive media for people to consume
- I think the aversion is that I don't want to be a ==consumer==, and the idea of making content for people to consume therefore feels bad
- ==Solution== → I think an easy-ish reframe here is therefore "I'm making this stuff for me". It's an act of creation and enjoying creation, it's not about if people will "consume" it or not. Maybe I can even encourage people to make stuff, share stuff with me, I was a passive consumer for x years because *modernity* but trust me bro it's real fun. Maybe I could bring back challenges and stuff
- ==Solution== → think about what I'd like my youtube channel to be about/to do. Because, I had a very energy-producing story/mission of "I'm making a song a day", and now I don't have that
	- Really, it could just be videos about everything from this site. "I'm learning to live well. I'm improving my thinking. I'm writing more. Here's how to make a website like this. Here's how to make a vlog, here's how to meditate/a guide to the best ideas from tpot"
		- Because yeah, my Youtube era 1.0 was *just* about "how I'm trying to be more creative". So what about era 2.0 being "here's *everything* I'm trying to be better at, nothing is kept away from youtube for being too niche/unusual/etc"
#### Overwhelm at all the options
- See e.g. [[02. Don't be overwhelmed!]] → there's a sense of like "there's so much that could be said, so little can be squeezed into a 10 minute youtube video"
- The trick really is just to start and try to lock in something like 1 video a week
### Substack
- I write *loads* on this website, pretty much just for my 2 friends in our ~rationality group chat to read. I should probably be taking this stuff and making twitter threads, youtube videos, ==substack== posts, etc
- Somehow my substack subscriber count surprises me the most. Why the hell do 58 people subscribe to my substack?? That's way more than I would guess
- Again, an audience capture fear of "are they there to learn about 'consensus-ism'?"
- ==Solution== → I think locking in the behaviour of 1 substack per week would be smart, and pretty easy to do, especially considering how much I already write on this website! 
## 2b. Not having in-person friends/community


## 2c. Not having some kind of online container for accountability and force-multiplication etc
