- What is currently stressing me out, that I can change?
- What is currently ridiculous in my life

---
# 1. Actively stressing me out
- [[Skillful vs Unskillful Mind|Unskillful mind]] re: ruminating about my family all the time. (I've spent the last 1.5 weeks in a Spanish hospital helping my Dad, and he's been driving me mad, and on the drive to and from the hospital I think about how much he drives me mad, which is not very skillful at all)
- Not having a locked-in way to make money that feels safe
	- I'm working for Outcapped, but it's an early stage startup

# 2. Not a source of stress, but silly when I think about it
- Stuff that, in the [[Ignoti nulla cupido]] way, isn't stressing me out because I'm used to it either never being a part of my experience, or I have given up on it being part of my experience, implicitly
## 2a. Not having a significant online platform
- ðŸŒˆ *Alex returns to the internet better than ever before* ðŸŒˆ
- [[My relationship with Twitter and tweeting, 2025-08-23]]
- [[My relationship with making Youtube videos, 2025-08-23]]
- [[My relationship with writing on Substack, 2025-08-23]]
## 2b. Not having in-person friends/community
- [[The state of my in-person community, 2025-08-23]]
## 2c. Not having some kind of online container for accountability and force-multiplication etc
- [[The state of my "network of people working on the same stuff", 2025-08-23]]
## 2d. Not having clear goals, a clear mission
- [[Imagining that my "open questions" are actually solved by prediction markets of experts, 2025-08-23]]
## 2e. What do I have to show for myself?
- There's something here around "I do so much thinking and planning and writing etc, but what actual legible wins do I have under my belt, recently"
- Rather than "oh well I set up this digital scrapbook website and it's given me a new place to think and plan way more", like "I identified these 5 key things to ship, and shipped them", you know what I mean 
- So, [[Locking in simple deliverables 2025-08-23]]
