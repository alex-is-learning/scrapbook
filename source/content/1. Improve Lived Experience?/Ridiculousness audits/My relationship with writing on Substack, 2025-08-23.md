- I write *loads* on this website, pretty much just for my 2 friends in our ~rationality group chat to read. I should probably be taking this stuff and making twitter threads, youtube videos, ==substack== posts, etc
- Somehow my substack subscriber count surprises me the most. Why the hell do 58 people subscribe to my substack?? That's way more than I would guess
- Again, an audience capture fear of "are they there to learn about 'consensus-ism'?"
- ==Solution== â†’ I think locking in the behaviour of 1 substack per week would be smart, and pretty easy to do, especially considering how much I already write on this website!
