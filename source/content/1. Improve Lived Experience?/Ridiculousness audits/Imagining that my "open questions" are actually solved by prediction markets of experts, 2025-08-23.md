- From my parent page on ORI â†’ [["What does it mean to be in ORI?" (Open Question)]]
- Last time I thought about this was on my birthday, lol
	- [[Thinking about ORI phase 3, 2025-08-05]]
- The outcome/update, I think, was that
	- My emotions can block me, because I conceptualise my problems as being too big and thorny to be solved
	- Vs actually, I don't have a *single* hyper-niche problem that wouldn't have straightforward answers
	- Defender's "[How attention markets work](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-attention-markets-work?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2)" gave me the idea of a website where ==you post your open questions, and experts weigh in==, in a prediction-market way
- *Note that the problem with the below is that I can only consider options that I'm already aware of, and I'm not getting the wisdom of the crowd*
## How do I ruminate about my family less?
### 1. By going to family therapy with each family member
- <1% overall score
- Sasha Chapin made some great points:
	- The logistics of this seems very difficult, as family therapy isn't very common, I don't have a car, it'll be slow going
	- It'll be expensive
	- It's coming from a place of trying to force people to change
### 2. By cutting my family out of my life
- <1% overall score
- Seems lonely, and a classic failure mode of leaving unskillfully and then being resistant to certain thoughts
### 3. By improving my skillfulness via meditation
