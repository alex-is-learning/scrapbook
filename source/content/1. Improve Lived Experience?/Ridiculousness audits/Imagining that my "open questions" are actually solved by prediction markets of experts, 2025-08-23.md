- From my parent page on ORI → [["What does it mean to be in ORI?" (Open Question)]]
- Last time I thought about this was on my birthday, lol
	- [[Thinking about ORI phase 3, 2025-08-05]]
- The outcome/update, I think, was that
	- My emotions can block me, because I conceptualise my problems as being too big and thorny to be solved
	- Vs actually, I don't have a *single* hyper-niche problem that wouldn't have straightforward answers
	- Defender's "[How attention markets work](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-attention-markets-work?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2)" gave me the idea of a website where ==you post your open questions, and experts weigh in==, in a prediction-market way
- *Note that the problem with the below is that I can only consider options that I'm already aware of, and I'm not getting the wisdom of the crowd*
# Pretending this website exists
## "How do I ruminate about my family less?"
### 1. By going to family therapy with each family member?
- <1% overall score
- Sasha Chapin made some great points:
	- The logistics of this seems very difficult, as family therapy isn't very common, I don't have a car, it'll be slow going
	- It'll be expensive
	- It's coming from a place of trying to force people to change
### 2. By cutting my family out of my life
- <1% overall score
- Seems lonely, and a classic failure mode of leaving unskillfully and then being resistant to certain thoughts
### 3. By improving my skillfulness via meditation
#### "If I did forgiveness meditation for 30 minutes a day for a month, I'd feel better about my family"
- 80% total score
#### Will I be able to lock in forgiveness meditation for 30 minutes a day for a month?
- 20% total score
#### If I did daily fetters work for a month, I'd feel better about my family
- 95% total score

# Cba to do more of the above right now, so let's cut to the chase, imagining the highest-rated answers:
- **Family**? → just do Fetters work & daily face deconstruction meditation
- **Money**? → just lock in to Outcapped and be as useful as possible
- **Creating/Platform-Building**? → just do 1 youtube vid a week, 1 substack a week, a written vignette a day
- **Connecting with more people**? → plan a group house with Simmo and visit intentional community(s) in the meantime
- **Learning to think**? → this isn't your bottleneck, just keep writing stuff in your digital scrapbook
