# Sit duration
- Why do I struggle to sit for more than 20 mins?
- How important is it to sit for a longer time? I've definitely seen this meme shared re: e.g. if you give up on meditation before the ~40 minute mark. I think I remember them saying on the Jhourney retreat that it takes ~40 mins before you've properly settled in, and then the good stuff can happen
