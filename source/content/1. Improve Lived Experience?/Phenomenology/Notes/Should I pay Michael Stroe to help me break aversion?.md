## Do I believe him?
- Yep, I believe in the fetters model, and imagine you can totally break them via a direct method, vs meditation
	- A friend talked about old-school buddhism being like being in a pitch-black cave and meditating for 1000s of hours until you eventually stumble across the light switch, vs more modern/cutting edge methods being like, having someone say "hey, it's over here! The light switch is over here!"
- [[The fetters model]]
## Why not do it? 
- Cost → I currently have low income and am trying to spend as little as possible
- Not grokking the profundity 
	- I think if I could "peek into" the experience post-breaking the fetters, it'd be like "oh duh, this is such a good investment"
	- I think because the fetters are so pervasive, it's not this clear thing. It's not like "get taught how to do jhanas", it's like "unlock a totally new mode of being"
# So, let's grok the profundity more
- Does he have writeups? What are the fetters anyway? What do you break in what order? 
- [[Weakening fetters 4 and 5]]
## Was ~stream entry profound? 
- Yes, probably the most profound thing that has ever happened to me 
## Is there still work to be done?
- Yes, I am wildly judgemental, negative rumination about my family, anger, bitterness
## Could progress in the 4 path model help?
- Yes, the 5th fetter is "ill will"
## So, could 2nd path, 3rd path be as profound as 1st path?
- If they're even a quarter as profound, will be amazing
- If 1st path erased my social anxiety because of "oh shit, there's no real self here, nothing to worry about"
- Then 2nd/3rd path could lead to "oh shit, there's no need for ill will, because xyz" → would be *deeply* profound
- Ill Will *is* my problem right now. "How do I orient to my family" is AKA "how do I stop being so angry at my family" which is AKA "how do I stop having so much ILL WILL towards my family"
