	- So lame, but I'm superrrr fried from the work trial 
	- Tomorrow I think I want to return to 1 hour long sits, or at least, think about duration. I've been wondering if 1 hour is excessive when you're a beginner (but then, it's what I did during the Finder's course, and it go me to access concentration)
- Wed 2025-08-06
	- only 10 mins, wah. should have messaged my friends to create accountability
	- Feel really fried after a day of the work trial
- Tue 2025-08-05
	- Left it too late and broke my 8-day "1 hour long sits" streak!
		- Did 30 minutes from 23:30, intending to do an hour, but started to fall asleep during the sit
		- Goodbye to my 9 day streak! But it's no worries. Back on the horse tomorrow, at an earlier time 🙏
