# 1. The halcyon days of ipods
- There was a time when we all owned an ipod
- I had an ipod nano 4th generation

- My friend Tom had a third generation. Look at this fuckin chode

- My uncle had an ipod classic, and it was beefy. Possible 80GB, when my nano has only 8GB. He had all the Harry Potter audiobooks, and I was in awe

- This was the era of itunes, of limewire, of your earphones getting insanely tangled in your pockets
- Why halcyon? Because there was still friction
	- Your ipod couldn't access the internet, no streaming, no youtube. You needed to plug it into your computer to add new things to it. So you could plausibly reach a point of "eh, there's nothing on there that I want to listen to". This is profoundly far removed from airpods connected to a smartphone
	- Wire earphones are kind of annoying - they get all tangled, you have to untangle them. It doesn't sound like much, but compared to the "always ready to go in your ears" nature of airpods, it's actually very different
# 2. Airpods
- Airpods are designed in such a way that there is *never* friction
- Multiple devices
	- Airpods are much nicer than traditional bluetooth earphones, if you're in the Apple ecosystem, because they effortlessly switch between your macbook and iphone, just depending on which one is currently playing audio. So, I could be watching a youtube video on my laptop, pause it, go to make a cup of tea and play a podcast on my phone instead, and the airpods switch effortlessly, no pairing and unpairing, no lag, it's great
- Great pass-through and noise cancellation
	- Even on a walk where you don't want to listen to anything, you can put them on noise cancellation mode to be more "alone with your thoughts"
- Connect to the magical internet device in your pocket
	- Unlike an ipod that you have to manually upload stuff to, airpods can be used to listen to new voice notes from friends, to *send* new voice notes to friends, to stream music via Spotify etc, listen to podcasts, listen to audio books, listen to youtube videos. You will truly never run out, unlike an ipod where you may be kinda sick of your music
