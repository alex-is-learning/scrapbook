- [[Meditation log]]
- Calling this sit 0 because it's pre-me locking in a proper routine
- **Date & Time:** Monday 2025-07-21, 08:15
- **Duration:** 20 minutes 
	- *(was aiming for 30 but got restless)*
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
- **Summary of the Sit:** 
    - I think I'm already a bit more aware of the inside of my nostrils from doing it yesterday - on a walk yesterday I was also paying attention to my nostrils a bit and it felt like the sensations had been upweighted. I imagine it's similar to flashcards (or learning a skill like the guitar) - when you sleep on it and then wake up, your brain has "consolidated" somewhat, and you find things easier
    - Overall, still super mind-wander-y, of course. ~95-99% distracted
- **Key Takeaway / Question:** 
    - I think it's just a case of getting the first let's say ~5 hours in
# My meditation setup
- I already have this goofy little tiny meditation cushion from amazon
- Yesterday I was like "ooh, I know, I need knee cushions, that was a key thing I learned at the vipassana retreat"
- And then I realised "hang on, I don't have to buy knee cushions from amazon, surely I have something I could use for free" → so I'm using my laundry bag and a blanket lol. Works perfectly 😎 shoutout to the new frugal Alex
