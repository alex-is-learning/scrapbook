- [[Meditation log]]
- **Date & Time:** Mon 4th Aug 23:20
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
- **Summary of the Sit:** 
    - A huge amount of my recent sits have been lost to angry rumination about my family
    - Probably time to switch to something like TWIM forgiveness?
    - Had some bouts of being fairly lost in thought, and some of being pretty mindful, e.g. the last ~10 minutes I caught myself getting distracted within a second or two, multiple times
- **Key Takeaway / Question:** 
    - How do I stop angry ruminating about my family? It's clearly unskillful and non-productive
# Meditated into my birthday! 
- It's now my 29th birthday 😎
