- [[Meditation log]]
- **Date & Time:** Sat 2025-08-02 21:30 
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
- **Summary of the Sit:** 
    - Hella distracted, you know me
    - I do think I can notice my nostril sensations a bit more now though...
- **Key Takeaway / Question:** 
	- Where am I in the "Mind Illuminated" framework? What should I be focusing on right now?
	- I feel like somehow since starting meditation again, I've totally "got" the thing of "the whole point as a beginner is the moment when you remember to come back to the breath, so there's no need to be mad at yourself for being distracted, it's 100% to be expected. As long as you're "remembering" dozens of times a day, you're getting your reps in, trust the process
