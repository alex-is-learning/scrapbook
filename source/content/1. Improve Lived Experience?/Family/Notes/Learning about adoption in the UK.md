- When I was ~8, my parents adopted a ~6 year old girl, and it didn't go particularly well (wrote a substack about it [here](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/the-shame-series))
	- *(Up until today, I thought I was 6 and she was 4 - just checked with my sister and she had more accurate dates (she has the paperwork))*
- Yesterday, the family therapist I met with was like "yeah, it's only in the last ~10 years that the government was properly offered support to families who go through with adoption". 
	- Learning about the ==systemic & policy factors== at play in our story will be ==very destigmatising== I think. 
	- Great "==systems view==" rather than a cause-and-effect "my parents just massively fucked up" view
	- So, learning about this feels very very useful! 
- Just ran these reports via [[Gemini Deep Research]]
1. `please tell me about child adoption in the UK from the 1990s onwards. I want to know about different eras, e.g., I have been told that in the last 10 years, the government has become much more proactive about offering families who go through adoption therapy. I want to know about things like success/failure rates, common issues, etc`
2. `please make a report about adoption in the uk in the present day, how it is framed, what support is offered, etc`
3. `please create a report about borderline personality disorder`
# Initial flashcards
- I read the first report (Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ur_AW_me0yaWYZrGevABHnuL_uURycaDf0eEDzlhSnc/edit?tab=t.0)) 
- Then I fed it to AI with my "make me flashcards" prompt
	- [[My "make flashcards for me" prompt for AI]]
- I then tweaked these somewhat and added them to [[Anki]]

like clashes in parenting styles between foster carers and adopters,

to describe the tangible, physiological changes in the brain and nervous system 
that children adopted from care carry with them
{{c1::An "invisible suitcase"}}
|
How does early life trauma 
typically affect the amygdala in a developing child's brain

{{c1::An interaction between a biological or genetic vulnerability 
and a chronically invalidating environment in childhood}}

|
