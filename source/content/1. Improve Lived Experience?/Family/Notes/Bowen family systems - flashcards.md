# Intro of "Bowen Theory's Secrets: Revealing the Hidden Life of Families"
```
The first book I read on family systems was by
{{c1::Jenny Brown}}
|
Title of first book on family systems that I read
{{c1::Growing Yourself Up}}
|
The second book on family systems that I'm reading is called
{{c1::Bowen Theory's Secrets: Revealing the Hidden Life of Families}}
|
The second book on family systems that I'm reading is by
{{c1::Michael Kerr}}
|
Name of person who developed family systems theory:
{{c1::Murray Bowen}}
|
The title of the second book on family systems that I'm reading was influenced by the book:
{{c1::The Hidden Life of Trees}} 
|
Forester Peter Wohlleben describes trees as {{c1::social beings}} and {{c1::the forest as a social network}}, 
which is analogous to how Bowen theory views families
|
Re: family systems
The idea of {{c1::the family as an emotional unit}}
requires a radical and difficult shift in conceptual thinking 
away from 
{{c1::individualism}}
|
While others like 
Ludwig von Bertalanffy 
and Norbert Wiener 
{{c1::extended systems theories to human behaviour}},
Bowen was the first to 
{{c1::study the family in a live-in setting}}
|
Details of Bowen's NIMH Family Study Project 
{{c1::was a long-term study of families having one young adult member diagnosed with schizophrenia}}
|
Re: Bowen's NIMH Family Study Project, what researchers weren't limited to
{{c1::As they could observe family interactions directly, 
researchers were not limited to what family members said about their interactions}}
|
Bowen recognised that family processes could not be conceptualised using conventional {{c1::cause-and-effect}} thinking
|
Re: Bowen's family systems
Cause-and-effect thinking assumes 
{{c1::the principal cause of a person's symptoms resides within the person}}, 
AKA {{c1::individual psychopathology}}
|
John Bowlby's attachment theory, unlike Bowen's, 
{{c1::placed the problem within the person of the patient and invoked maternal deprivation as its prime cause}}
|
Re: family systems
Systems thinking is necessary to describe 
{{c1::the reciprocal interaction process 
where the individual and the family each affect the other}}
|
In Bowen theory, "self" refers specifically to 
{{c1::differentiation of self}}
distinguishing it from other conceptualisations
|
The uniqueness of Bowen theory's concept of "self" is 
{{c1::that it includes how individuals function in relationship systems}}
|
(Bowen)
Re: accurately assessing the robustness of a person's "self" 
{{c1::Can only occur in the context of their relationship environment}}
|
(Bowen)
"Self" continuum
{{c1::A person's capacity to maintain "self" at one end 
to their vulnerability to lose "self" at the other}}
|
(Bowen)
The pressure for oneness in families was termed "{{c1::stuck-togetherness}}" 
and later {{c1::the togetherness force}}
|
The counterbalancing force to togetherness is individuality, defined as a life growth force toward differentiation of self
{{c1::individuality}}
|
The intellectual system, enabled by the cerebral cortex, allows humans to use reason to exert some control over emotional system functioning
{{c1::intellectual system}}
|
Feelings are subjectively experienced via the cortex but reflect activity of the ancient subcortical circuits of the emotional system
{{c1::emotional system}}
|
A key outcome of the NIMH Family Study Project was a method of therapy for the family unit
{{c1::the family unit}}
|
Therapy helps people see the hidden processes of how they lose "self" in a relationship, providing a blueprint for change
{{c1::lose "self"}}
|
Unlike psychodynamic therapy, Bowen theory uses a systems lens to view current real-world interactions
{{c1::systems lens}}
|
Being an individual while closely involved with others enhances the stability and adaptive capacities of a relationship system
{{c1::stability and adaptive capacities}}
|
When people lose the ability to be an individual in a system, it becomes vulnerable to increased anxiety, which can fuel symptoms
{{c1::symptoms}}
|
A systems view shifts from "I am helpful because you are helpless" to seeing it as a reciprocal process: the more helpless you act, the more helpful I get, and vice versa
{{c1::reciprocal process}}
|
Blaming others and blaming oneself are the enemies of gaining a systems perspective
{{c1::Blaming others and blaming oneself}}
|
Translating a new way of thinking into a new way of being requires conviction and courage
{{c1::conviction and courage}}
|
A hallmark of a successful effort to define "self" is that it does not disrupt a relationship but instead solidifies it and fosters mutual respect
{{c1::solidifies it}}
|
Basic levels of differentiation of self are associated with people's ability to adapt to stressful life circumstances
{{c1::adapt to stressful life circumstances}}
|
Where people fall on the differentiation continuum reflects their ability to use their intellectual system to distinguish between feeling and intellectual processes
{{c1::feeling and intellectual processes}}
|
Being more differentiated is not about suppressing feelings but about using an intellectual process to gain objectivity and emotional neutrality
{{c1::objectivity and emotional neutrality}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
Research on chimpanzees who 
{{c1::could point to a lower number of treats only if it was shown via an abstract symbol}} 
suggests a parallel for 
{{c1::using a theoretical concept to override an emotional impulse}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
The chimps learned to 
{{c1::choose the smaller reward 
when the treats were replaced by affectively neutral symbols (numbers), 
allowing them to restrain their impulse}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
One person's ability to firmly maintain "self" in an anxious system 
(6 words)
{{c1::interrupts the infectious spread of anxiety}}
|
(Re: Bowen)
It is unnecessary and counterproductive to try to change others; 
{{c1::managing oneself well}} is sufficient to halt escalating chronic anxiety
|
|
Making Bowen theory one's own requires shifting completely from 
{{c1::cause-and-effect thinking}}
to 
{{c1::systems thinking}}

```
# Chapter 1
- I've already read about systems theory & some of Donella Meadow's "Thinking in Systems: A Primer", so already feel like I grok the basics
```
In Bowen theory, there are (count) {{c1::8}} "{{c1::interlocking concepts}}"
|
The statement 
"{{c1::I feel depressed because you would rather work in your garden than be with me}}" 
is an example of 
cause-and-effect thinking
|
Cause-and-effect thinking seeks to explain behaviour by asking what primary question?
{{c1::Why?}}
|
(Bowen)
Rather than asking "{{c1::why}}", 
Systems thinking tracks a relationship process by asking what four questions?
{{c1::How, what, when, and where}}
|
In systems thinking, 
A husband's depression and his wife's withdrawal are not cause and effect, 
but are seen as a...
{{c1::reciprocal emotional process}}
|
Within systems thinking, 
{{c2::the flow of emotions between people that mutually alters their internal states and actions }}
is termed the...
{{c1::emotional process}}
|
Why is blaming one's partner considered nonsensical from a systems thinking perspective?
{{c1::Because both people help create the changes in each other to which they then react}}
|
In systems thinking, 
Anxiety-driven interactions that can lead to abuse 
are understood as a {{c1::reciprocal process where each person plays a part}}, 
rather than a simple
{{c1::perpetrator-victim dynamic}}
|
The primary determinant for success in family therapy, 
is the ability of 
{{c1::at least one family member to shift from cause-and-effect thinking to systems thinking}}
|
The more a family system lacks differentiation of self, 
the more pronounced its
{{c1::action-reaction process}}
|
In Bowen theory, 
What is the core concept that describes an individual's capacity to balance their 
{{c2::Emotional and intellectual functioning}}?
{{c1::Differentiation of self}}
|
Re: drives
An individual with a low level of "self" is 
{{c1::More governed by their reactions to cues}}
|
How does Bowen's concept of 'triangles' fundamentally differ from Freud's 'Oedipus complex'?
{{c1::Bowen's is based on systems thinking 
Whereas Freud's is an extension of individual, cause-and-effect thinking}}
|
(According to Bowen theory)
The driving forces for {{c1::energy and activity}} within living systems, 
reside in the...
{{c1::emotional system}}
```
# Chapter 2
```
How does Bowen theory's use of the term "emotional system" differ from common usage?
{{c1::It is used more broadly, 
including the adaptive mechanisms of even simple organisms like bacteria}}
|
Why does Bowen theory take such an expanded, evolutionary view of the emotional system?
{{c1::To ensure the legacy 
of billions of years of evolution on the human emotional system 
is not overlooked}}
|
What metaphor is used by Michael Kerr
to describe the process of observing an emotional system?
{{c1::Studying the wind}}
|
How is observing a family's emotional system similar to observing the wind?
{{c1::You cannot see the system/wind itself, 
but you can infer its presence and force 
by its effects on visible things (family members/trees and sails)}}
|
The flow of invisible {{c1::emotional forces}} through a family, 
inferred by its impact on members, is referred to as the...
{{c1::emotional field}}
|
A young man who acts childishly 
only when visiting his parents, 
and blames them for it, is failing to see the...
{{c1::reciprocal process that he unwittingly helps create}}
|
Bowenian perspective re: problems from the past causing problems in the present?
{{c1::The past doesnt create problems in the present
The problems are actively re-created by the participants in the present}}
|
From a Bowenian perspective, relationship systems can be seen as extensions of the...
{{c1::emotional systems of individual brains}}
|
The Bowenian perspective that the relationship system 
is {{c1::an extension}} of the emotion brain
rhymes with the idea of
{{c1::The Extended Mind Thesis}}
|
Bowen states that
Automatic human behaviours, such as 
{{c1::distancing in the face of intensity}}, 
may have their roots in primitive mechanisms found in
single-celled organisms
|
According to neuroscience, 
the brain's emotional system is primarily located in the
{{c1::Subcortical}} part of the brain
|
Neuroscience:
The brain's emotional system is AKA the {{c1::limbic system}}
|
The core of Bowen theory's concept of "differentiation of self" 
relates to the brain's ability to distinguish between 
{{c1::Feeling and thinking}}
|
A person with higher differentiation of self 
is able to be informed by both 
{{c1::feeling}} and {{c1::thinking}} 
but can ultimately choose to act on
{{c1::thinking}}
|
Two key limiations of the "wind" metaphor for family emotional systems:
{{c1::1 - people in a system help generate the "emotional wind" through their reactions
2 - People have some choice over their reaction to the emotional process}}
```
# Chapter 3
```
According to Bowen theory, the {{c1::smallest stable}} relationship system is known as a triangle
|
In Bowen theory, {{c1::a triangle}} 
is considered the "molecule" or basic building block of an emotional system
|
The inherent instability of a two-person system stems from 
{{c1::
the human conflict between 
the need for closeness 
and the fear of too much closeness (intrusion)}}
|
In an emotional triangle, the two people who 
{{c1::align together against a third}}
are known as the insiders
|
The individual in a triangle who 
{{c1::is blamed for the tension between the other two}} 
is referred to as the outsider
|
How does a triangle create stability for the two insiders?
{{c1::It allows them to externalise their anxieties onto a third person, 
blaming them for any tensions}}
|
The process of 
{{c2::anxiety shifting 
between the three relationships within a triangle}}
is known as {{c1::dynamic equilibrium}}
|
What happens when a single emotional triangle becomes overloaded with anxiety?
{{c1::A fourth person is drawn in, creating interlocking triangles}}
|
A series of {{c1::interlocking triangles}} 
can {{c2::spread anxiety infectiously through a group}}, 
leading to polarised subgroups
|
According to Bowen theory, 
group polarisation is caused by 
{{c1::an underlying emotional process}}, 
not primarily by 
{{c1::the beliefs the groups hold}}
|
A key difference between a healthy, principled alliance 
and an emotional triangle 
is that a triangle is 
{{c1::driven by anxiety}}
|
According to Bowen theory, 
the ability to manage the {{c1::closeness-distance}} dilemma more effectively
is a sign of a well-differentiated person
|
Poorly differentiated people are more likely to 
react to relationship anxiety by 
(3 things)
{{c1::shutting down, 
distancing, 
or becoming aggressive}}
|
What is a common strategy an outsider might use 
to gain an inside position in a triangle?
{{c1::Telling a negative story 
about one insider to the other insider 
to form a new alliance}}
|
In a triangle, the person in the {{c1::outside}} position absorbs {{c2::the anxiety generated by the system}}
|
The stability of the insiders' relationship 
often depends on their ability to 
{{c1::externalise their anxieties onto the outsider}}
|
Thinking that views behaviour as each person contributing to and responding to a larger relationship process is called {{c1::systems thinking}}
|
Gossip, involving talking about a third person, 
serves as a {{c1::primary vehicle for spreading anxiety through triangles}}
|
The more {{c1::anxiety-driven}} and {{c1::negative}} the emotional valence of gossip, 
the more likely it is to {{c1::create insiders and outsiders}}
|
In Bowen theory, 
people with a lower level of "self" 
are more dependent on {{c1::affiliation with a group}} 
to support their emotional functioning
|
What is the (adaptive!) primary function of a triangle within a relationship system?
{{c1::To compartmentalise anxiety, 
thereby impairing the functioning of as few people as possible}}
|
When tension arises between two insiders, 
what is a common way for {{c2::the more uncomfortable insider}} to react?
{{c1::To initiate closeness with the outsider}}
|
In Bowen theory diagrams, a square symbolises a {{c1::male}}
|
In Bowen theory diagrams, a circle symbolises a {{c1::female}}

Why family systems is like an anti-meme
{{c1::The emotional system is invisible, like the wind}}
|
Michael Kerr's family history:
{{c1::4 sons, one of whom committed suicide at age 35}}
|
The two things Bowen did that differed from Wiener and von Bertalanffy:
{{c1::Studied the family in a live-in setting}}
+
{{c2::Describe the specific factual details about how the families function as systems}}
|

Re: family and gestalt:
{{c1::The interactions of family members 
add up to a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts}}
|
Dates of Bowen starting work on his theory, to his death
{{c1::1946-1990}}
|
(Bowen)
The most important of the 8 interlocking concepts:
{{c1::Differentiation of self}}
|
Re: the term "differentiation":
Cell differentiation and integration are key to {{c1::the adaptive capacities of complex organisms}}
The differentiation of human beings is key to {{c1::the adaptive functioning of complex family units}}
|
The key learning from the NIHM project:
{{c1::A family functions as an emotional unit}}, meaning: 
{{c1::The emotional functioning of family members 
is far more interdependent 
than had been previously recognized}}
|
The core of emotional interdependence is that 
{{c1::a change in the emotional functioning of one member
is predictably associated with reciprocal changes 
in the emotional functioning of other members}}
|
Example of healthy interdependent functioning in a family:
{{c1::
If a wife falls and breaks her ankle, 
her husband modifies his schedule to take over functions that his wife would normally do
This, be overfunctions, she underfunctions}}
|
The pattern of overfunctioning and underfunctioning becomes a problem if 
{{c1::chronic anxiety is the drive}}
because
{{c1::now the over/under-functioning is driven by anxiety, not reality of people's functioning}}
|
One fundamental characteristic of an emotional system is people pressuring one another to 
{{c1::think and act alike}}
as this
{{c1::promotes a feeling of connection}}
|
(Bowen)
"{{c2::Togetherness force}}" is {{c1::the pressure for oneness and agreement in families}}
|
Certain communications and behaviors function to
to define and maintain "self" or distinctness within the group; 
other communications and behaviors function to 
maintain oneness with the group 
|
Identifying the two classes of behaviors in relationship systems 
({{c1::forces to maintain "self" vs forces to maintaine oneness}})
makes it possible to objectively study 
{{c1::the capacity to be a "self."}}
|
(Bowen)
Functional facts are 
{{c1::facts about how people function in relationship to one another}}
|
How to objectively study the capacity for "self" in a relationship system:
{{c1::Observe the two forces ("self"-maintaining vs togetherness)}}
|
An inflexible person who cannot relinquish the control position 
and a person who cannot relinquish the helpless position 
are {{c1::pressuring each other to function in a certain way}}, 
which is a product of {{c2::the togetherness force}}
|
(Bowen)
The counterbalancing force to {{c1::togetherness}} is {{c1::individuality}}
|
(Bowen)
An expanded definition of individuality:
{{c1::a life growth force toward differentiation of self}}
|
The {{c1::cortical}} components comprise what Bowen theory defines as 
{{c2::the intellectual system}}
|
(Bowen)
The intellectual system enables human beings to 
{{c1::think/reason/reflect}}
and 
{{c1::use those abilities to exert control over some aspects of emotional system functioning}}
|
{{c1::Self-regulation}} is a key ingredient for maintaining "self,"
in an anxious social context
|
Bowen, re: the intellectual system
(2 words each)
Cortical components {{c1::guide actions}};
Subcortical components {{c1::motivate actions}}.
|
Variation in the development of {{c1::the intellectual system}} among individuals 
is central to explaining variation among human beings in
their ability to maintain "self" in relationship systems
|
In contrast to modern neuroscience, 
Bowen theory permits study of the "self" by
{{c1::observing how people function in relationships}}
|
In the NIMH study, the researchers discovered that 
motivated family members could
{{c1::could learn to apply factual knowledge 
about predictable relationship processes in their family 
to improve their ability to maintain "self" in the system}}
|
Re: how learning about family systems is useful
{{c1::When people see the specific
(previously unobserved/hidden) 
processes of how they lose "self" in a relationship, 
this provides a blueprint that helps them 
figure out what they need to do to be more of a "self" in the system}}
|
It may seem counterintuitive, but the ability to 
{{c1::be an individual while closely involved with others}}
enhances the stability and adaptive capacities of a relationship system
|
Being more of a "self" begins with 
(4 lines)
{{c1::using the lens of systems thinking
to observe the basic emotionally driven patterns 
that exist in family relationship systems 
and one's part in sustaining those patterns}}
|
Of Vervaeke's 4 Ps,
the first part of being more of a "self" is
{{c1::perspectival}}
in that in involves
{{c1::using the lens of system thinking
to observe the emotional patterns in the system
and one's part in sustaining them}}
|
The second part of being more of a "self" is
{{c1::translating this new way of seeing 
into a new way of being}}
|
Of Vervaeke's 4 Ps, 
the second part of being more of a "self" is
{{c1::participatory}}
in that it involves
{{c1::a new role, a new posture, a new salience landscape}}
|
Doing the second part of being more of a "self" requires
{{c1::Courage and conviction}}
as
{{c1::you need to step into a new way of being}}
|
Surprisingly, successfully defining "self" {{c1::fosters mutual respect}}
|
Re: the intellectual system
"This possibly unique human capacity 
enables a choice between whether to 
{{c1::act on thinking and a long-term view}}
or to
{{c1::act on feelings to relieve the anxiety of the moment}}
|
One family member having an improved understanding of 
{{c1::how the family system functions}}
and 
{{c1::his or her part in the system problem}}
allows for 
{{c2::more "self" to emerge}}
and 
{{c2::an associated reduction in system anxiety}}
|
The sureness and firmness that come from
{{c1::comprehending both sides of a reciprocal interaction
and our own part in it}}
is a vast improvement over trying to act calm and being rigidly rational
|
The Bowen "single continuum" is a continuum of {{c1::emotional functioning}}
|
Re: the Bowen continuum:
People at one end generally can
{{c1::recognize thoughts and viewpoints 
that are strongly influenced by emotions 
more than by facts about the reality at hand}}
and people at the other end 
{{c1::have great difficulty making this distinction 
or, even if somewhat aware, still succumb to the emotions}}

In the intro to "Bowen Theory's Secrets"
The book
"{{c1::The Righteous Mind (2012)}}"
is cited as 
"beautifully describng the powerful, pervasive, and largely out-of-awareness impact 
of {{c1::emotion on thinking}} 
|
On the journey of using Bowen's theory
You increase your level of conviction by
{{c1::acting on a system 
and getting the predicted result}} 
|
Quote from Sapiens
{{c1::A theory that enables us to do new things}} constitutes knowledge.
|
The magic of changing yourself, with knowledge of systems theory:
{{c1::You can work at changing yourself 
without feeling like you are giving up or giving in
Because you know that changing yourself 
leads to substantive changes in others as well}}
|
Metaphor for husband and wife both thinking the other is to blame
(3 words)
{{c1::Chinese Finger Trap}}
Because
{{c1::Each spouse is equally reactive to the other}}
or 
"{{c1::It takes two to tango}}"
|
Cause-and-effect thinking asks 
"{{c1::why does the other person treat me this way?}}"
perpetuating
{{c1::victim mindset}}
whereas system thinking asks 
{{c2::how, what, when, where}}
AKA
{{c2::Meta-level mindset}}

## Chapter 2, round 2 (manual flashcards)
- I spotted a parallel to Plato's 3-part psyche from a recent Vervaeke video I watched 😎
```
In the chapter "evolution and the emotional system"
Kerr states that 
The study of behavior best begins 
{{c1::in the context of relationships}}
|
People often object to being compared to ants or naked mole rats, 
but this is precisely the message of Bowen theory: 
{{c1::human beings have far less autonomy
in their emotional functioning 
than we generally assume}}
|
The parts of Plato's 3-part soul:
{{c1::The many-headed beast
The lion
The human}}
|
Plato's 3-part psyche:
The many-headed beast is
The {{c1::Appetitive}} Part
|
Greek for Plato's many-headed beast
{{c1::Epithymetikon}}
|
Plato's many-headed beast contains
{{c1::all our physical appetites and desires 
(for food, drink, sex, and money)}}
|
Plato's 3-part psyche:
The lion is
The {{c1::Spirited}} Part
|
Greek for Plato's lion:
{{c1::Thymos}}
|
The thymos is the seat of your {{c1::social emotions}}
|
The thymos craves 
{{c1::honour, recognition, and victory}}
|
Plato's 3-part psyche:
The human is
The {{c1::Rational}} Part
|
Greek for Plato's human part of the 3-part psyche
{{c1::Logistikon}}
|
Greek:
Many-headed monster - {{c1::Epithymetikon}}
Lion - {{c1::Thomos}}
Human - {{c1::Logistikon}}
|
The human part of Plato's 3-part psyche:
Its function is not just to be clever, but to 
{{c1::guide the entire system towards what is good and real in the long term}}
|
Where Plato's 3-part psyche comes from
{{c1::The Republic}}
|
Additional metaphor used by Plato re: the soul
{{c1::A charioteer (Reason) 
driving two winged horses}}
|
Plato's 2 horses:  
{{c1::Noble & white = the spirited thymos  
Unruly & black = the appetitive monster}}
|
To Plato, 
The charioteer's lifelong struggle is 
{{c1::to get the two horses to work together to ascend towards the truth.}}

Bowen quote:
We live our lives in 
{{c1::networks of emotional forces
that follow triangle patterns}}
|
{{c2::Cause and-effect thinking}}
is the principal obstacle to seeing 
{{c1::the patterns of emotional functioning}}
that Bowen theory describes.
|
There are (count) {{c2::4}} 
{{c1::patterns of interaction}}
in Bowen theory
|
In Bowen theory, 
The {{c1::patterns of interaction}}
are the key variables for explaining 
{{c2::which family member develops clinical symptoms}}
|
Obvious turmoil in family system:
People assume that 
{{c1::the turmoil results from 
distress about the symptomatic person's impaired functioning}}
This is a half-truth 
The other half is
{{c1::The role of the relationship system 
in creating and maintaining the impaired functioning}}
|
Bowen liked to say, 
"The way to prevent schizophrenia
{{c1::is to try to create it}}" 
|
Bowen's point re: "the way to prevent schizophrenia"
{{c1::Parents are anxiously trying their best _not_ to create it
And this anxiety harms the child}}
|
Two examples of "functioning positions" in Bowen theory:
{{c1::
Inside vs outside the triangle
Overfunctioning vs underfunctioning in dyad}}
|
(Re: family systems)
The denouement of one's efforts is 
{{c1::to use the propositional & perspectival knowledge gained 
to guide changes in one's actions 
such that they are constructive for self and for others (participatory knowledge)}}
|
Bowen theory's main point is that 
{{c1::
marital conflict, 
dysfunction in one spouse, 
and transmission of the problem to one or more children 
are all expressions of the same thing}}
{{c2::undifferentiation 
and associated chronic anxiety 
in the nuclear family system}}
|
Bowen theory's main point is that

(Bowen)
The four patterns of emotional functioning: 
{{c1::Dominant-Adaptive (Deferential) Interactions}}
{{c1::Emotional Conflict}}
{{c1::Triangles (originally "impairment of a child")}}
{{c1::Emotional distance}}
|
The 4 emotional patterns in Bowen's theory function to 
{{c1::control the intensity of emotional fusion in relationships}}
|
What is Kerr talking about when he says "emotional fusion"
{{c1::A state of intense emotional interdependence 
where the boundaries between individuals become blurred}}
|
You can be emotionally distanced despite physical proximity, e.g.:
Avoiding potentially emotionally charged topics. 
|
Emotional distance and bound anxiety:
{{c1::The anxiety is bound in the avoiding emotionally charged topics}}
|
A way of describing the binding of anxiety is that 
{{c1::the anxiety is integrated into the structure of a relationship}}
|
On many occasions, Bowen stated: 
"If I had to reduce my theory to one basic idea, it would be that 
{{c1::it explains how two people can begin their relationship very close, 
but become increasingly distant over time}}" 
|
According to Bowen theory, you can learn to regain a mature closeness by
{{c1::understanding how each person's immaturity undermined it 
and then applying that knowledge to change one's part in the process}}
|
As a result of reading 
{{c1::Sociobiology: The New Synthesis}}
Michael Kerr modernised some of Bowen's terminology
|
Michael Kerr modernised 
{{c1::Marital conflict}}
to 
{{c2::Emotional conflict}}
|
Michael Kerr modernised 
{{c1::Dysfunction in one spouse}}
to 
{{c2::dominant-adaptive (deferential) interactions}}
|
The one of the four patterns of emotional functioning 
that Michael Kerr modernised into a mouthful
{{c1::Dominant-adaptive (deferential) interactions}}
|
Why Michael Kerr found {{c1::Sociobiology: A New Synthesis}} to be relevant
{{c2::The studies of the social groups of a wide range of species described in the book 
reveal the existence of close parallels 
between the patterns of emotional functioning that Bowen theory describes 
and similar patterns in other species}}
|
Michael Kerr modernised
{{c1::Transmission to one or more children}}
to 
{{c2::Triangles}}
|
Of the 4 patterns of emotional functioning
Which did Kerr not rename?
{{c1::Emotional distance}}
|
In a dyad, 
The {{c2::adaptive}} or {{c2::deferential}} one is
(specific)
{{c1::the person making the most behavioral changes 
in an attempt to maintain harmony 
in the relationship}}
|
In a dominant-adaptive interaction
It's not always the case that the overfunctioner is the dominant partner
{{c1::The overfunctioner may be adapting disproportionately in the relationship 
under pressure from the underfunctioner}}
|
Why triangles are of central importance in Bowen theory
{{c1::Because they show how relationships are interlinked}}
|
A diagram that shows all 4 Bowen emotional patterns:
{{c1::(Screenshot from pdf page 55)}}
|
Kerr:
"It is important to note that 
{{c1::dominant-adaptive (deferential)}} interactions
are very common when the conspecifics of many species are living in
proximity. 
They are {{c2::the emotional basis of social hierarchies}}
|
What the dominant-adaptive (deferential) diagram looks like:
{{c1::(Screenshot from page 57}}
|
An {{c1::overfunctioning-underfunctioning}} reciprocity 
is anxiety-driven, 
whereas 
{{c1::role differentiation}}
is reality-driven
|
Role differentiation in a family:
{{c1::People taking on specialized tasks 
that render a family or social system more functional and adaptive}}
|
Example of anxiety-driven overfunctioning-underfunctioning:
{{c1::Male feels calmer when he's in charge
Female feels calmer at not having to be primary decision maker}}
|
Example of overfunctioner disproportionately carrying family anxiety
{{c1::Having to work hard to meet perceived expectations of others
The families often seemed heavily dependent on these people}}
|
Re: overfunctioners carrying family anxiety
"The overfunctioners looked dominant, 
but these were cases of the overfunctioners being 
pinned down in the one-up position}}
|
The person most vulnerable to dysfunction
in a dominant-adaptive (deferential) patten is
{{c1::the one making the most internal adjustments in functioning 
to preserve harmony}}
```

The most active pattern of emotional functioning in a family 
can change over time. 
E.g.:
{{c1::A dominant-adaptive pattern may characterize the early years of a marriage
but this can shift into one of emotional conflict or emotional distance later on}}
|
"The following quote by Jonathan Haidt is speculative, 
but the idea fits with much of human experience: 
"{{c1::Reasoning has evolved not to help us find truth, 
but to help us engage in arguments, persuasion, and manipulation 
in the context of discussions with others}}"
|
(Emotional conflict pattern)
Bowen theory states that 
when emotions are intensely involved
reason 
{{c1::operates in the service of emotion}}
not 
{{c1::in the service of a careful assessment of the facts}}
|
What Bowen means by using "reason" 
in a dubious way
during emotional conflict
{{c1::Reason operates in the service of emotion
and alleged attempts to act "reasonable"
only fan the flames}}
|
Emotional conflict & anxiety
Both sides {{c1::blame each other for the problem}}, 
which is calming for both:
But 
{{c1::the anxiety is now bound in both people dogmatically adhering to their own viewpoints}}
{{c1::Include the diagram from page 60!}}
|
The upside of emotional conflict is that 
{{c1::It externalises the anxiety rather than internalising it
So each person is less vulnerable to developing mental/physical symptoms}}
{{c1::(Diagram from page 60}}
|
Michael Kerr:
Emotional conflict is a fascinating pattern because
{{c1::people maintain contact and enforce distance at the same time 
(Poking at the other gets a reaction and pushes the other away at the same time)}}
|
Up to a point, the emotional patterns 
{{c1::stabilise relationships}}
but lead to dysfunction if
{{c1::sufficiently high levels of chronic anxiety develop}}
|
Michael Kerr
Emotional conflict arises from 
{{c1::Neither person having enough "self" 
To feel that going along with the other's wants and ideas 
Isn't "giving in."}}
|
Kerr sometimes describes the emotional conflict pattern as 
(2 words)
"{{c1::puntuated disequilibrium}}
Where (first word) refers to 
{{c1::the brief closeness phase}}
|
In emotional conflict
A common but unsuccessful strategy for avoiding exhausting arguments:
{{c1::One person trying not to take the bait}}
Why it fails:
{{c1::It only makes the one who wants some type of response angrier - 
they escalate until the other explodes}}
|
3 characteristics of immature parents:
{{c1::
1. Automatic, feeling-based reactions
2. Lack of reason and reflection
3. Difficulty maintaining appropriate emotional boundaries (distances vs overly intrusive
}}

Bowen first called the triangulation:
"{{c1::Impairment of one of more children}}"
|
Kerr merges two phrases into "triangulation"
{{c1::Impairment of one or more children"
and
"Family project process"}}
|
Kerr's reason for using the term 
triangle 
to  cover 
{{c1::impairment of a child}}
and 
{{c1::the family projection process}}
is 
{{c2::to emphasize that the dyadic interaction between mother and child 
occurs in the context of a triangle}}
|
Re: which emotional pattern is damaging for a kid:
{{c1::
If the dominant-adaptive 
or emotional conflict
patterns bind anxiety in the marital relationship, it protects
the children to some degree 
it creates less impairment than child focus (triangulation) does}}
