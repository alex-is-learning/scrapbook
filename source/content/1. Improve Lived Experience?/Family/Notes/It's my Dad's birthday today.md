- It's my Dad's birthday today
- I haven't spoken to him all year
- Part of my "stop pretending everything is fine" thing involved writing him a (caustic, unskillful) letter, which he of course couldn't process well, it just got his guard up 
- I'm planning on doing something more skilful at some point, but my mum & sister are priorities, seeing as they're the ones I grew up with - he's never been a real significant player in my life. Maybe one day! Just not right now
