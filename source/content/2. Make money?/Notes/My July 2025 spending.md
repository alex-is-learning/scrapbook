- Your total spending for July 2025 was **Â£669.39**.
- This was split between:
	- **Ad-hoc spending:** Â£465.85
	- **Monthly spending:** Â£203.54
# Month of getting my spending in order
- Finally did the aversive thing of:
	1. Looking through my accounts to see what I'm subscribed to
	2. Cancelling various things
- Big wins:
	1. Cancelled amazon prime â†’ next day delivery massively increases the amount of things I buy from them. Huge reduction in amazon purchases this month! Enormous savings
	2. Realised I could cancel my Adobe yearly subscription early (with a Â£70 cancellation fee ðŸ˜…)
	3. Realised I've been paying for a gym that I haven't visited in ~1 year without realising, at Â£23/month ðŸ˜… ðŸ˜­
	4. Reckoning with my "book buying addiction" - probably bought ~15 books recently, stupid as they take a long time to read!

- Turns out I've been paying Â£23 a month for a gym I signed up to probably a year ago when I was in Blackpool short-term ðŸ˜­
- Re: invisalign â†’ Â£1,995.00 total, Â£83.12/month, I've got Â£664.96 left to pay
	- [ ] expensive but worth it IMO, my teeth were getting noticeably wonkier over time as I lost my post-braces retainer when I was an undergrad

## Books
### Socrates books
- John Vervaeke recommended the top 3 for his "After Socrates" series. I read the Ward Farnsworth book in ~3 days and made loads of flashcards from it (e.g. [[06. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 â†’ the rationale]]) â†’ totally worth the money, I really enjoying scribbling in the hardback

## Learning
- Â£39 for a month of Superprof. It's insane that you have to pay that much just for the privilege of messaging tutors. But, I figured I'd pay for 1 month, message as many people as I need, then cancel and no longer need their platform
- And I got to have two free calls with possible philosophy tutors, and I chose one of them to go ahead with, who gave me readings ([[Superprof tutor lesson 1 (The Fundamental Decision)]]), so, worth the money!
## Food
- Some snacks to celebrate getting my contractor role at Outcapped
