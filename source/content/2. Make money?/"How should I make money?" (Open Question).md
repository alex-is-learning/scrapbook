- **1-paragraph manifesto** 2025-08-23 â†’ I'm currently making money as a contractor, but it's not guaranteed, as it's an early stage startup. Should I keep applying for other roles, double down on this role and work hard to help the company succeed, cementing my place as a great team member, some other, third thing, a mix, etc?

- 2025-09-08 post-Ship It Week â†’ no longer working at Outcapped, and I think want I want to do is say "fuck it, maybe I'll run out of money, let me just fully follow the aliveness, make things and spend time with people"
