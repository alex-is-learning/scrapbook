# Artistic beginnings
- *August 2025 marks the time when I now want to take this seriously (or at least, as seriously as the above photos) â†’ Substacks, videos and songs before this time were more joyful and joyfully shitty exploration, feel free to disregard in a major way*
## Substack
- "[The end of cringing self-justification](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/the-end-of-cringing-self-justification)" (12th September 2025)
- "[I know what 'my thing' is](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/ship-it-week)" (30th August 2025)
## Vignettes
- I've been writing [[Writing - vignettes|vignettes]]
- My favourites so far are [[01. To be a boomer|to be a boomer]], [[02. Don't be overwhelmed!|don't be overwhelmed]], [[06. Cornflakes|cornflakes]] and [[07. Travel day|travel day]]
