# Intro
- Hi! Welcome to my ==digital scrapbook== :) 
-  ![[profile-pic-pixel.webp|120]]
- [[🪵 Log per day]] ← <span class="text-red">this is where ~everything goes!</span> 🚨
- *(I'm vaguely aligned with the Open Research Institute, see [[Old website intro]])*
- It currently serves a few purposes:
## 1. Focusing on my open questions
- [[⭐️"How can I improve my ability to think? (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️"How can I change how to orient to my family?" (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️"How should I make money?" (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️ "What do I do with the things I love?" (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️ "What is next for me after living at my mum's?" (Open Question)]]
- [[⭐️ "What does it mean to be in ORI?" (Open Question)]]
## 2. Thinking in public
- [[Writing public-facing manifestos, slash showing your thought process, seems powerful]]
- E.g. 
	- [[What does it mean to be a professional meta-cognitionist?]] 2025-08-18
	- [[Are visual notes underrated and poorly understood?]] 2025-06-24
	- [[Should I meditate regularly?]] (2025-07-20)
	- [[What I currently know about Bowen family systems theory|What I know about Bowen family systems theory]] (2025-07-18)
	- [[06. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 → the rationale|Learning the Socratic Method]] (2025-07-05)
	- [[How can I operate from a place of uncertainty?]] (2025-07-08)
	- [[08. Enneagram 3 thinking sins|Enneagram 3 thinking sins]] (2025-07-06)
- This has the great benefit of getting me to ==think more clearly & robustly==
- It also may lead to me ==making more stuff== - substack posts, youtube videos, etc
	- [[Lemon tree → lemon curd → lemon pie 🍋]], where this place is me picking lemons, super low effort, may turn them into lemon curd later, maybe not
