# Intro
- Hi! Welcome to my ==digital scrapbook== :) 
-  ![[profile-pic-pixel.png|120]]
- It currently serves a few purposes:
## 1. Focusing on my open questions
- **Focusing on my open questions**
	- [[⭐️"How can I improve my ability to think? (Open Question)]]
	- [[⭐️"How can I change how to orient to my family?" (Open Question)]]
	- [[⭐️"How should I make money?" (Open Question)]]
	- [[⭐️"How do I meditate regularly?" (Open Question)]]
## 2. Thinking in public
- E.g. 
	- [[Should I meditate regularly?]]
	- [[What I currently know about Bowen family systems theory]] 
	- [[06. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 → the rationale|Learning the Socratic Method]]
	- [[How can I operate from a place of uncertainty?]]
	- [[08. Enneagram 3 thinking sins|Enneagram 3 thinking sins]]
- I'm finding that having something that is publicly visible acts as a really great incentive to write more. 
	- Stuff published here feels much more "real" than stuff that I might write for myself and then lose in a giant overwhelming Obsidian vault, or that gets tucked away in a Google Drive folder, never to be seen again.
