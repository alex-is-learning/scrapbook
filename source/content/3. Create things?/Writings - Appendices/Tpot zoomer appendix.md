- [[03. To be a tpot zoomer]]

The vignette is about tpot overwhelm, but then of course there's also just general zoomer overwhelm 

- I've got messages to reply to, whatsapp, signal, group chats, emails
- I have my tool stack, apple notes to capture ideas, but also to track things I need to do, tasks ranked by priority, which I mostly procrastinate on. A whole decade long "productivity" journey, mostly arriving at the insight that none of these systems work, that something essentially as simple as a paper pad is the way
- Then there's like... emails, job applications
- All the books I could read
- All the things I could do - should I learn to code? should I make youtube videos? should I grow my substack? should I go back to uni? should I focus on work? Should I go on a work sabattical for a year and seriously meditate? 
- and everything's built to be addictive, the pull of youtube, of twitter, dopamine hits, validation. so hard to focus, to lock in. even now there's the pull to check my twitter notifications, ha, I just went to do it and my hotspot has switched off so i can't, that's actually a relief
- then there's also fitness - cardio, tracking macros, going to the gym, stretching, trying to stay lean, trying to lose weight. creatine, vitamins
- there's also the learning of new tools, using AI a bunch, gemini deep research, keeping up to date with AI news
