2. As of 2025-08-22 I've just started a separate little writing website, after I got some nice feedback
	- https://alexislearning.me/learning-to-write
	- I wanted to write stuff that's a bit more... emotive? And as this current website (that is, learning to *think*) is something that I sometimes share with job applications, I wanted a separate place for non-thinking things


- I'm yet to write up a manifesto for this. But basically, there are various things that I've been very passionate about in my life, and I've never quite known what to *do* with all that energy
- The answer is probably "create stuff"
