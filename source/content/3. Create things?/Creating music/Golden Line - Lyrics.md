I saw the sun slide across the lake on a golden line

Take time, searching for signs

A satellite flying blind

Stuck like a moon between the Earth and nothing else to speak of
  
Wish I was here, wish I wasn’t

Wish I was here, wish I wasn’t

Wish I was here, wish I wasn’t

Wish for one good moment that might have happened

No more dread, and no regrets, I’ll put those to bed

All the choices I have made will confound, the ocean and the wave 

Swimming with arms like buildings sealed to the ground 

Wish I was here, wish I wasn’t

Wish I was here, wish I wasn’t

Wish I was here, wish I wasn’t

Wish for one good moment that might have happened

What to me was worth it proved to you a burden

I could see the past through rosey colored glasses too

The wheel keeps on turning 

The wheel keeps on turning 

Wish for one good moment that might have happened

Wish for one good moment that might have happened
