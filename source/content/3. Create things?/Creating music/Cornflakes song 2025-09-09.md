- [[Music making log (era 2)]]
- Experimenting with turning a vignette into a song
- [[06. Cornflakes]]
- ![[cornflakes-song.m4a]]
 - Damn I really like how this turned out!!!!!!
 - In era 1 I found lyric writing *really really painful*
 - So this is iteration 1 of writing something first and then turning it into a song
 - This feels so much better!!!!

G                     C            G
Cornflakes, cafeteria, cappuccino 
Dirt on my feet, dust in my hair 
C                            G
Crumbs in the cracks of the chair 
D
And I've melted three times in two days 
G
From the kindness of strangers 
D                            D7
Love sparkling shyly between us
C
Laughter 
G
Not a thought in my head
C                 G
I want to see you again
C                G
I want to see you again
