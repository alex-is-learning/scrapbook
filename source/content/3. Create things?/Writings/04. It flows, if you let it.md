It's effortless, it flows, if you let it. It's inexhaustible, it doesn't tire. There's tiredness, of course, there's doubt and fatigue and a creaking in your bones. Tension in the shoulder, forearms aren't feeling great. Fuck the doubt! Don't second guess! Not to mention that twinge in your glutes. So this is life, someone flipped a switch and now you need to stretch daily, or else it catches up with you, fast. *You* can catch up with *it*, a different "it", the it of your potential, resonance, something of that nature. Alignment and flow and fittedness are a subtle move away, relax, slow down, smile, enjoy. Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy. Years of habit. There's angst in the water, I don't blame you, it's no wonder you're suffused. To drink the poisoned water, and to add poison of our own. But remember, it's a choice. You will always have the choice. See things differently, it's your birthright. Innumerable joys every day, if you remember to look. We're drowning in meaning, we forget the gifts, we don't see the holy water we swim in. Look around now - we are all of us brothers.
