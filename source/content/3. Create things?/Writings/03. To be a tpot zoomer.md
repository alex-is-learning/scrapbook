To boom is to expand, to take up space, bloat and broaden. To zoom is to rush, to flit, to skim and to scan. To want it all, to deepen on every axis, to master every way of being, right now, it must be now. To have an executive summary understanding of a great many things. To have never drank deeply, for how could you stop? You have to keep moving, you have to keep sprinting from cup to cup, as maybe the next one will shimmer and sing and whisper "you've found me". 

Should I read meditationbook.page? Should I learn the jhanas? What about vipassana? Maybe fetters work is the thing? Or no, shadow work? Or maybe psychedelics would let me speedrun some insights. Ketamine therapy to process my trauma. TRE to shake it out, deity practice to remodel my self image, IFS to heal my parts, ideal parent figure protocol for my attachment style, Do Nothing practice to help unclench, try a cold shower to remember what clenching is, you're so used to doing it all the time, subtly, fractal-y. Fractal, that's right, I should form a group house. No, not ambitious enough, it should be a community hub. It's up to us to save this city, and then after that, the world. But first of all, let me scroll a bit more.
