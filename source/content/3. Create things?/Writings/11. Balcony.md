Memories to power me a while longer yet
Still in my chest, an easy smile, I owe and wonâ€™t forget
Timeline cleanse, new would-be friends, cruft burned clean 
Lonely late-night coffee with some wistfulness between
People to miss, to kiss, highlight reels pour forth with this
The balcony where we first met
To pause again, a cigarette 
To harmonise, a strange duet
