```
I don't miss the way you smiled at me 
Cuz I know it's gone 
And I know I'm not what you see
And it won't be too long
Before it fades into memory

# Cornflakes song - Tuesday 2025-09-09
- Experimenting with turning a vignette into a song
- [[06. Cornflakes]]

 - Damn I really like how this turned out!!!!!!
 - In era 1 I found lyric writing *really really painful*
 - So this is iteration 1 of writing something first and then turning it into a song
 - This feels so much better!!!!
```
G                     C            G
Cornflakes, cafeteria, cappuccino 
Dirt on my feet, dust in my hair 
C                            G
Crumbs in the cracks of the chair 
D
And I've melted three times in two days 
G
From the kindness of strangers 
D                            D7
Love sparkling shyly between us
C
Laughter 
G
Not a thought in my head
C                 G
I want to see you again
C                G
I want to see you again

## 30 second song ("I mind")
- Really struggling to sing well lol RIP 
- ![[2025-09-08 I mind.mp3]]
- Fun because I just quickly made the world's most basic drum beat, looped it, played 3 chords
- Spent like 5 mins playing around with the lyrics 

```
I say I don't mind where I go
I've come to my senses
And I know
That I mind
Yeah I mind 
Oh I mind
```

- I like this! Simple way of talking about the like "oh I don't mind living at my mum's for 6 months, I'm not missing out on anything because I'm trying to build a good life" â†’ "oh shit, community rules ([[Ship It Week log]]), I really should care less about how much money I have left and spend more time with people"
- Alternative version

	- Total ripoff from track 2 of the new Wet Leg album, first line + general chord progression, feels great to have the permission to "steal like an artist"

- Felt good to return to Ableton after 8 months away and still be able to slap something together! 
### Guitar effects stack
- ![[1757341459046.webp]]
- Now I have Ableton Suite (overkill, I should probably have just been a GarageBand boy until my production skills improved enough), I've got the built-in Ableton amps & cabinets
- As my macbook broke, I don't have any of my plugins and saved effect chains, which is kind of a bummer, but also kind of nice to start fresh and minimalist
### Vocal effects stack
- ![[1757341535200.webp]]
- I just asked Google Gemini what the 80/20 effects stack would be
## Quick trip-hop drums thing
-  Found a cool drum loop in Ableton, pitched it down at one point, kinda just a cool lil fragment, I'm not skilled enough to do anything with it but was fun!
