---

- I emailed Sasha on Saturday (it's Wednesday now)
- Basically saying "I think I'm a good writer, but I think I could get much smarter about it, what do"
- He replied today saying that he doesn't really do writing coaching any more but that if I have any specific questions
# What I'm really looking for is like... holistic creative advice
- I want to make youtube videos + substack posts + songs
- I had a good slowly growing youtube presence during the 3 months I made videos (0-440 subscribers)
- I'm kind of stuck in lowbie hell on twitter (and substack) and I'm not sure what to do differently 
## Setting the stage
- Sasha has ==25,000== substack followers, I have ==64==
- Sasha has ==38,000== twitter followers, I have ==236==
	- (I used to have ~750 until my old account got suspended because they thought I was a bot)
- I have ==414== youtube subscribers
	- Was steadily growing in the 3 months I made videos, then had an 8 month hiatus
## I want to get serious about this, full time, [[Death Ground]]
- It is time for me to accept that I can't make money via my old ways → I just tried doing internal operations contracting for a startup and mannnnn was it grindy
- I'd rather be a starving artist than have savings but not be in flow (?)
- I have ~6 months of runway and want to work on this stuff full time
# What are my specific questions?
## 1. The meta question is just "what am I doing 'wrong'", or, "what does it look like to do it *right*"
- I have some hunches here, like writing too much for me and not enough for others
	- DFW's [[Expressive Mode vs Communicative Mode]]
- I'll go into this in more detail below
## 2. How to go from "friends like it" to "more people like it"
- (This might be essentially the same as the meta question, just reworded)
- Currently on Substack, I'll write something in one go, and it's good in a scrappy way, and it describes my current lived experience 
- But like, this isn't what Sasha does
- What does he do?
	- [Notes Against Note-Taking Systems](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems)
		- Concisely articulates a strong opinion that goes against the grain and provides a new framing against second-brain systems
	- [10x happiness increases are possible, and this is an underrated fact](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/10x-happiness-increases-are-possible)
		- As with his deep okayness post → shows people how much better things can be
	- [Talking Enneagram 7 blues](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/talking-enneagram-7-blues)
		- Vivid writeup of being a type of guy. I shared this was an enneagram 7 friend and she was incredibly grateful to me for *sharing* it, so yeah, very potent
	- [What maximum productivity looks like for me](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/what-maximum-productivity-looks-like)
		- Similar to "notes against note-taking systems" in that it describes a different way of being that is "healthier" than the zeitgeist
### ==Solution 1== - only publish things that are ~essential
- I publish ~everything I write 
- Scrolling through Sasha's posts, it's like "holy shit, that one rules, and that one, and that one, and I really want to getting round to reading that one", etc, etc
- So there's a feeling of essential-ness - only publishing the stuff that is really good and essential
- This is probably also the case for tweets too - having a more strict quality filter
### ==Solution 2== - provide value to non-friends
- I think I kinda solved this problem for youtube, but not for Substack
	- On youtube, I inspired other wannabe creatives - "hey, here I am attempting to make music, I'm shit at it but I'm having fun!" - got lots of comments about being inspiring
- How to provide value to non-friends
	- I think the answer might be... "==provide value, whether that be inspiration, or new ideas==, etc"
		- Sasha posts about ways of being (peak productivity, how to write), possibility space-expanding stuff (10x happiness increases are possible)
- Vs, providing value mostly just to *me*
	- E.g., me writing about how I'm angry ([newest post](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/wednesday-at-ship-it-week)) → friends are like "hell yeah!", but anyone who doesn't know me won't read it
	- It's not *essential*
	- It's like [the Mom Test](https://www.momtestbook.com/)
		- *"'The mom' in The Mom Test represents a figure who, out of love and a desire to be supportive, will likely give you encouraging but ultimately unhelpful and biased feedback on your business idea."*
		- I think my friends aren't lying when they say my writing is good, but I think they have a skewed idea of how much non-friends would like it. 
		- E.g. my friend [Simmo](https://x.com/MrSimmoSimpson) was like "if you write a substack a day for a year, there's no chance that you wouldn't be successful" which I did not believe at all. I guess in a year I'd have time to find the correct approach...
### ==Solution 3== - write about a specific topic, and work on it for a few days+
- What I currently do: 
	- As I write it in one go, publishing a few hours after starting, the title comes to me at the end, is retro-fitted on, and doesn't fully describe the writing - the writing isn't this cohesive thing, usually, it's more the various things that have been alive for me 
- So, could one solution be to work for multiple days on a thing that already has the title in place
- Example post titles of mine:
	- "[Becoming angry](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/wednesday-at-ship-it-week)"
		- I arrived at this title, and at becoming angry, like 33% of the way through, it starts as more of a Ship It Week retrospective
		- The OG title was "Wednesday at Ship It Week", which ofc is not very engaging, lol
	- "[I know what 'my thing' is](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/ship-it-week)"
		- Another retro-fitted title, at first this was just called "Ship It Week"
		- There's an impulse in me to share everything that is going on, or at least to set the scene, and I suspect that it might be the "finding yourself way more interesting than most other people will" thing that DFW talks about ([[Expressive Mode vs Communicative Mode]])
	- "[On being "in-group": tpot vs EA](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/on-being-in-group-tpot-vs-ea)"
		- This one is scrappy (as they all are, but this one feels more so) - can imagine I could have sweated over this quite a bit more and made it more coherent
	- "[I got suspended from Twitter and it hurts which is good](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/i-got-suspended-from-twitter-and)"
		- Good in a first-draft, "interesting to friends" way
### Solution 4 - how to discover a good title & topic?
- This can happen my typical way, free-writing a first draft, and seeing what emerges
- From Sasha's "Notes Against Note-Taking Systems"

> 	"Most heart-stopping writing comes from synthesizing the previously unarticulated in the moment. Rather than reaching for your database, try channeling what’s in the air at this very second. If it’s some stunted, fragmentary version of an idea you were exposed to previously, that is good. These read/write errors are what we call originality."

- My problem has been that I've been so pleased with myself for writing a good first draft that I publish that first draft after a bit of polishing
### Solution 5 - how to work on things for multiple days?
- It feels very good and alive to write and publish something in one session, with some polish
- But, I do feel that I've convinced myself here that that approach won't work for getting non-friends to care
- So, I think it's just a case of making a Google Doc for a post, and refining it over multiple days, and even sending it to friends for thorough feedback
- Only publishing that which is *essential*
# Blockers
## Impulse to share everything
- An impulse to share everything
	- There's an impulse in me to share everything that is going on, or at least to set the scene, and I suspect that it might be the "finding yourself way more interesting than most other people will" thing that DFW talks about ([[Expressive Mode vs Communicative Mode]])
	- In a way I am very impressed by myself, a real "pinch yourself" quality to how much better things are now, how much I've grown, etc. Combine this with the enneagram 3 desire for approval, the enneagram 3 tendency towards vanity, and the "I didn't make anything for years and years, this is new to me, I want to share it all", and you have someone who shares every first draft because they're so thrilled with themselves for breaking the working class generational trauma mould and making something
