- From [[What help do I want from Sasha Chapin re writing etc?]]
- I'm not necessarily endorsing much of what ChatGPT has written here, but I wanted to experiment with it as I'm not ready for Sasha's >$200/hr coaching yet
- The below are in reverse-chronological order, that is, heading 1 is the most recent reply
# 1. Re: Sasha's feedback (throat-clearing)

- Sasha replied and said that my writing is quite moving but has a tonne of throat-clearing preamble in it
- ChatGPT expands on this:

Short answer: **yes**—Sasha’s note sharpens the plan. We keep the “new work” sprint, but add one non-negotiable: **start at the kernel and delete the throat-clearing**. He literally flagged “a ton of throat-clearing,” said your post’s heart was moving but took forever to arrive, and suggested you “write what’s sacred,” assume readers already get you, then cross out the remaining preamble. Also: let the Enneagram-3 anxiety of not managing perception happen—that’s good. 

## What changes now

- **Kernel-first rule (60 words):** open with the ==sacred claim or outcome== in ≤60 words; no context, no disclaimers. Only after the claim do you give one proof, then the how-to. This directly follows his “sacred + assume affinity + delete preamble” guidance. 
- **Throat-clearing purge (mandatory pass):** before publishing, run the checklist below; if the first paragraph still reads like hedging or scene-setting, ==delete it and re-read==. Repeat until the piece starts at heat. 
- **Assume “already liked” points:** ==stop pre-justifying who you are== or why you’re allowed to say this. Spend those words on the claim, proof, and practice. 

## Next 48 hours (all new work)

### **1) Monday essay (new)**

**Working title:** _Quit the “Good Mood First” Rule._
- <span class="text-red">Note - ew, this is fucking disgusting, lol. Looks like gen AI is still dreadful at this stuff (creativity suggestions. Good for strategy though!)</span>

**Kernel opener (paste this, then adjust to taste):**

“**I write well on bad-brain days by starting ugly on purpose.** A timer, a whispered outline, and one terrible paragraph give me enough momentum to make something I’m proud of.”
- <span class="text-red">Why is it even bothering, smh</span>

**Then:** one concrete proof from this week → the 3-step mini-system → 2 pitfalls → invite to try it today.

### **2) Thursday video (new)**

**Title:** _Start Ugly: Write With Me for 15 Minutes (Timer On)._

**No intro spiel.** Cold-open with the promise: “By minute 3 you’ll be typing.” Then show the timer + whisper outline, one ugly paragraph, a 60-second micro-edit, and a single CTA.

### **3) Friday micro-piece (new)**

**Prompt:** “Name one sacred thing you refuse to apologize for.”
- <span class="text-red">I think I refuse to take writing prompts from AI, which is maybe silly. But I trust my aliveness much more</span>

To quote the man himself

> "Your natural salience filter is a great determinant of what’s most alive to you. If you begin to rely on any other filter, you will increasingly record what _seems like it should be interesting according to some preexisting criteria_ rather than what organically sticks to your mind. This is a tradeoff. It is often not a worthy tradeoff."

- 👆 from https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems

**Constraint:** 120–180 words. First sentence = the claim. No backstory.

## **Throat-Clearing Purge — fast checklist**

==Delete or rewrite anythin==g that:

- Explains why you’re writing (“I want to talk about…”, “I’ve been thinking a lot about…”)
- Manages perception (“This might be dumb…”, “I know this won’t apply to everyone…”)
- Recaps biography or travelogue before the claim
- Over-hedges (“kind of,” “maybe,” “in some ways”)
- Meta-talks about process (“I’ll probably write more on this later…”)
    
**Tests:**
1. **Paragraph-1 guillotine:** remove it. If the piece improves, keep it gone.
2. **First-line swap:** can your second paragraph be line 1? Make it so.
3. **Stranger scan:** would a stranger know what they get by line 2?
## **Structure to follow on every new piece (for now)**

**Claim (≤60 words) → One proof (scene or stat) → How-to (1–3 steps) → One vivid moment → Invite.** This implements his “sacred first, assume affinity, cut preamble” note exactly. 
## **One tight question to send Sasha (optional)**
- “Here are two kernel openers (≤60 words) for my next essay—**which one is hotter** and what one sentence would you cut?”
- He asked for specific questions, so this matches his bandwidth. 
- If you want, I can draft the full Monday essay now using the kernel-first template.

# 3. ChatGPT on my [[What help do I want from Sasha Chapin re writing etc?]] post + snippets of both our writings

I read your “What help do I want from Sasha…” page plus your two Substack posts from Ship It Week, and I skimmed a bunch of Sasha’s pieces you linked. Here’s the short of it, then a concrete plan.

## **What I’m seeing (super quick read)**

- You’ve already ==proven flow== + output: 40 YouTube videos in ~3 months, 400+ subs, a 7.7k-view video with a lively comment thread; you enjoy being on camera. 
- You want to make YouTube + Substack (+ maybe songs), have ~6 months runway, and you’re asking Sasha for targeted, opinionated guidance. 
- Your current Substack cadence leans “==expressive mode==” (alive, first-drafty, friend-coded), and you’ve already intuited the need to publish only the “essential” and write more for non-friends. 
- You have ==clear themes== (trauma → agency → kenshō; creative practice; modern life upgrades) and a good self-diagnosis: ==title-last, topic-drift, low cohesion==. 
- Sasha’s writing patterns you admire: strong POV posts that reframe (“10x happiness…”, “Notes against…”), vivid “type of guy” portraits, and practical metaphysics (void intimacy). These are useful north stars.

---

## **Your next 30 days (do this first)**

1. **Pick a simple weekly cadence you can actually keep for 6 weeks**
    - **Mon:** ==1 “essential” Substack essay== (reader-first; 900–1,500 words).
    - **Thu:** ==1 YouTube anchor== (6–8 min) that _embodies_ the essay (not a read-through).
    - **Fri:** ==1 vignette== (short, poetic, totally for you)—but only if the Mon essay shipped.
- This blends your joy (vignettes/video) with audience gravity (one useful essay/week). Your own doc points to “consistency” as Phase 2—let’s actually operationalize it. 
    
1. **Adopt the “Essential Only” filter you proposed**
    - Before you draft: ==write the **promise sentence**== (what a stranger gets). 
    - If you can’t write a crisp promise, it’s not essential yet. 
    - You already guessed this move; I’m just making it non-negotiable. 
    
2. **Title-first, outline-first**
    - Your problem isn’t ideas; it’s cohesion. Start with a ==compelling, specific title== and a 5-bullet outline that delivers your promise. You named this as a likely fix—lock it in. 
    
3. **Refactor one existing post into a reader-magnet**
    - Take **“Becoming angry”** (currently expressive + scattered) and turn it into:
    - **New title:** “How I Turned Restless Anger into Creative Fuel (A 10-Minute Protocol)”
		- <span class="text-red">As always, ChatGPT writes the most hideous LinkedIn slop when it comes to "creativity" - but the object-level advice is good</span>
    - **Outline:** a) why anger ≠ enemy, b) the 10-minute body drill you actually used this week, c) how it changed your writing session, d) pitfalls, e) one invitation.
    - **Keep** one or two raw paragraphs (your voice) as texture.
    - This respects the alive core while delivering value to non-friends, which you’ve already flagged as the gap.
    
4. **Relaunch YouTube as the “hub,” but smaller**
   - ==One weekly video tied to the Monday essay.== Cold-open with the outcome (“By the end you’ll have X”), then story, then 1 concrete practice. You already planned a hub return—ship it with constraints.
   - 🤔🤔🤔 What about music too 🤔🤔🤔
	   - Maybe it's a written vignette, which is then turned into a song 😎 
    
6. **Distribution ritual (30 minutes/day, timer on)**
    
    - Thoughtful comments on 2–3 adjacent Substacks or videos (add an angle, not a promo).
    - 1–2 tweets/notes that _condense_ Monday’s idea into something quotable.
    - ==Ask 2 people privately==, “If you liked this, who else should see it?”
	- This is the boring “Holy Work” consistency that Sasha says helps 7s stop chasing novelty and actually build something.

## **60–90 day arc (how this becomes momentum)**

**Pillars (rotate weekly):**
- <span class="text-red">This is the themes that ChatGPT has pulled out from the few writings I shared. Would actually be useful to be like "here's all my writings, and this fuckin website too, what are my key themes"</span>

1. Agency & inner tech (how you got from social anxiety → camera ease; void/meditation tactics).
2. Working-class → weirdly good life** (practical systems; money, friendship, place). Tie to your family arc without getting trapped in memoir. 
3. Creative practice lab (vignette craft, 3-step editing heuristic, shipping muscles).
4. Experiments in public (Ship-It-style challenges you run for yourself + readers). 

- KPIs (weekly): 
	- *feels like it's kinda chatting shit here*
	- 1 essential post; 
	- 1 video; 
	- 1,000+ words drafted; 
	- 2 external comments/day; 
	- 5 email replies solicited (“What part helped most?”). 
	- Monetization later—first grow trust.
- **Monetization sniff test (month 3):** 
	- <span class="text-red">this feels icky to think about right now</span>
	- consider a light “supporter” tier only if you’ve hit 6–8 consecutive essential posts and you’re getting unsolicited “this helped me do X” replies (Sasha’s “10x happiness” point: more happiness → more capacity; translate that to reader outcomes before paywalls). 

---

## **Make Sasha’s life easy (send him 6 laser-specific questions)**
- <span class="text-red">Not listening to any of this - all gross af</span>
- He said he’ll answer specifics. Copy/paste a tight note like this:

1. “Of your post archetypes, which 2 would you double-down on _early_ for Substack growth—and why? (e.g., reframes like ‘10x happiness’, ‘Notes Against…’, or vivid ‘type-of-guy’ portraits?)”
2. “Looking at _this outline_ for ‘How I Turned Restless Anger into Creative Fuel’, what would you cut/add to make it essential?” 
3. “From 0→5k and 5k→25k subs, what were your 1–2 most effective distribution habits (not hacks)?” 
4. “How do you personally decide when a draft is ‘essential enough’ to publish?” 
5. “Any red-flags in my proposed weekly cadence (1 essay, 1 video, 1 vignette) you’d change?”

This respects his boundaries and invites short, opinionated answers.

## **Two quick craft checklists you can use today**


**The “Essential Essay” checklist (print this):**
- Title makes a promise to a stranger. 
- 1–2 core ideas, not 7.
- Concrete practice or takeaway.
- 1 vivid personal moment for texture (not the whole thing). 
- Cut 20% of sentences; front-load the value.
- End with “If you try this, tell me what changed.”

**The “7-proof workflow” (to stay out of novelty chasing):**
- 5 minutes of “void sit” → outline → draft → break → edit → ship. 
- Novelty (music/tweets/extra ideas) _after_ ship.

---

## **One note on big life changes**

Sasha’s “blow it up” essay is pro-change, but also notes the ~6-month stabilization window. You’re already on “Death Ground” with 6 months of runway—so for this window, keep your _environment stable_ and blow up your _process_ (cadence, editing, distribution) instead. Then reassess at Day 90. 

---

## **If you want a fast start this week**

- **Refactor “Becoming angry”** into the protocol piece and publish Monday. 
- **Record a 6–8 min companion video** Thursday demonstrating the protocol (show, don’t tell). 
- **Draft next Monday’s “essential” now**, title-first.
- **Send the 6-question note to Sasha** with your outline attached. 

You’ve already got the spark and the engine. This plan just puts bumpers on the lane so the ball keeps knocking pins over—week after week.
