- From [[What help do I want from Sasha Chapin re writing etc?]]

I read your “What help do I want from Sasha…” page plus your two Substack posts from Ship It Week, and I skimmed a bunch of Sasha’s pieces you linked. Here’s the short of it, then a concrete plan.

## **What I’m seeing (super quick read)**

- You’ve already proven flow + output: 40 YouTube videos in ~3 months, 400+ subs, a 7.7k-view video with a lively comment thread; you enjoy being on camera. 
- You want to make YouTube + Substack (+ maybe songs), have ~6 months runway, and you’re asking Sasha for targeted, opinionated guidance. 
- Your current Substack cadence leans “expressive mode” (alive, first-drafty, friend-coded), and you’ve already intuited the need to publish only the “essential” and write more for non-friends. 
- You have clear themes (trauma → agency → kenshō; creative practice; modern life upgrades) and a good self-diagnosis: title-last, topic-drift, low cohesion. 
- Sasha’s writing patterns you admire: strong POV posts that reframe (“10x happiness…”, “Notes against…”), vivid “type of guy” portraits, and practical metaphysics (void intimacy). These are useful north stars.

## **Your next 30 days (do this first)**

1. **Pick a simple weekly cadence you can actually keep for 6 weeks**
    
    - **Mon:** ==1 “essential” Substack essay== (reader-first; 900–1,500 words).
    - **Thu:** ==1 YouTube anchor== (6–8 min) that _embodies_ the essay (not a read-through).
    - **Fri:** ==1 vignette== (short, poetic, totally for you)—but only if the Mon essay shipped.
        - This blends your joy (vignettes/video) with audience gravity (one useful essay/week). Your own doc points to “consistency” as Phase 2—let’s actually operationalize it. 
    
2. **Adopt the “Essential Only” filter you proposed**
    - Before you draft: ==write the **promise sentence** (what a stranger gets)==. 
    - If you can’t write a crisp promise, it’s not essential yet. 
    - You already guessed this move; I’m just making it non-negotiable. 
    
3. **Title-first, outline-first**
    
    Your problem isn’t ideas; it’s cohesion. Start with a _compelling, specific_ title and a 5-bullet outline that delivers your promise. You named this as a likely fix—lock it in. 
    
4. **Refactor one existing post into a reader-magnet**
    
    Take **“Becoming angry”** (currently expressive + scattered) and turn it into:
    
    - **New title:** “How I Turned Restless Anger into Creative Fuel (A 10-Minute Protocol)”
        
    - **Outline:** a) why anger ≠ enemy, b) the 10-minute body drill you actually used this week, c) how it changed your writing session, d) pitfalls, e) one invitation.
        
    - **Keep** one or two raw paragraphs (your voice) as texture.
        
        This respects the alive core while delivering value to non-friends, which you’ve already flagged as the gap.
        
    
5. **Relaunch YouTube as the “hub,” but smaller**
    
    One weekly video tied to the Monday essay. Cold-open with the outcome (“By the end you’ll have X”), then story, then 1 concrete practice. You already planned a hub return—ship it with constraints.
    
6. **Distribution ritual (30 minutes/day, timer on)**
    
    - Thoughtful comments on 2–3 adjacent Substacks or videos (add an angle, not a promo).
        
    - 1–2 tweets/notes that _condense_ Monday’s idea into something quotable.
        
    - Ask 2 people privately, “If you liked this, who else should see it?”
        
        This is the boring “Holy Work” consistency that Sasha says helps 7s stop chasing novelty and actually build something. 
        
    
7. **Guardrails for your Enneagram-7 jet engine**
    
    - **Void reps:** 5 minutes/day of doing nothing before you write (befriend the discomfort so you _don’t_ go title-hopping mid-draft). 
        
    - **One project at a time** during a session; novelty only after the day’s “essential” ship. (His “7 blues” piece nails how novelty becomes avoidance; we’re countering it.)

## **60–90 day arc (how this becomes momentum)**

  

**Pillars (rotate weekly):**

1. **Agency & inner tech** (how you got from social anxiety → camera ease; void/meditation tactics).
    
2. **Working-class → weirdly good life** (practical systems; money, friendship, place). Tie to your family arc without getting trapped in memoir. 
    
3. **Creative practice lab** (vignette craft, 3-step editing heuristic, shipping muscles).
    
4. **Experiments in public** (Ship-It-style challenges you run for yourself + readers). 
    

  

**KPIs (weekly):** 1 essential post; 1 video; 1,000+ words drafted; 2 external comments/day; 5 email replies solicited (“What part helped most?”). Monetization later—first grow trust.

  

**Monetization sniff test (month 3):** consider a light “supporter” tier only if you’ve hit 6–8 consecutive essential posts and you’re getting unsolicited “this helped me do X” replies (Sasha’s “10x happiness” point: more happiness → more capacity; translate that to reader outcomes before paywalls).

## **Make Sasha’s life easy (send him 6 laser-specific questions)**

  

He said he’ll answer specifics. Copy/paste a tight note like this:

1. “Of your post archetypes, which 2 would you double-down on _early_ for Substack growth—and why? (e.g., reframes like ‘10x happiness’, ‘Notes Against…’, or vivid ‘type-of-guy’ portraits?)”
    
2. “Looking at _this outline_ for ‘How I Turned Restless Anger into Creative Fuel’, what would you cut/add to make it essential?” 
    
3. “From 0→5k and 5k→25k subs, what were your 1–2 most effective distribution habits (not hacks)?” 
    
4. “How do you personally decide when a draft is ‘essential enough’ to publish?” 
    
5. “As a classic 7, what habits help you avoid ‘sugar-through-glass’ vibes and stay sincere on the page?” 
    
6. “Any red-flags in my proposed weekly cadence (1 essay, 1 video, 1 vignette) you’d change?”
    

  

This respects his boundaries and invites short, opinionated answers.

## **Two quick craft checklists you can use today**

  

**The “Essential Essay” checklist (print this):**

- Title makes a promise to a stranger. 
    
- 1–2 core ideas, not 7.
    
- Concrete practice or takeaway.
    
- 1 vivid personal moment for texture (not the whole thing). 
    
- Cut 20% of sentences; front-load the value.
    
- End with “If you try this, tell me what changed.”
    

  

**The “7-proof workflow” (to stay out of novelty chasing):**

- 5 minutes of “void sit” → outline → draft → break → edit → ship. 
    
- Novelty (music/tweets/extra ideas) _after_ ship.

## **One note on big life changes**

  

Sasha’s “blow it up” essay is pro-change, but also notes the ~6-month stabilization window. You’re already on “Death Ground” with 6 months of runway—so for this window, keep your _environment stable_ and blow up your _process_ (cadence, editing, distribution) instead. Then reassess at Day 90. 

---

## **If you want a fast start this week**

- **Refactor “Becoming angry”** into the protocol piece and publish Monday. 
    
- **Record a 6–8 min companion video** Thursday demonstrating the protocol (show, don’t tell). 
    
- **Draft next Monday’s “essential” now**, title-first.
    
- **Send the 6-question note to Sasha** with your outline attached. 
    

  

You’ve already got the spark and the engine. This plan just puts bumpers on the lane so the ball keeps knocking pins over—week after week.
