- There's a sense in which I'm done with my "it feels great to make things for the sake of making things" arc
- Actually no, that's not quite it, more like "it feels good to hit publish on stuff even if it's kinda shitty or first draft, just because it feels so great to finally be making stuff"
- I'm excited to enter a new era where I maybe spend a whole week on a video or essay before publishing it, rather than pretty much always making & publishing in a single session
# From expressive to communicative?

- I don't think this is even necessarily it - it's not like I now want to shift to making stuff *for other people*, more that I want to go from "this is just a kernel of an idea but I'll publish it anyway" to "I've worked on this until it's actually pretty good and now I'm publishing it"
- But maybe there is some of the "E to C" thing here of "ok is this good enough for other people to like", rather than like "here's 9 minutes of me chatting shit"
# What will it look like to make good stuff?
- I think it's as simple as "work on things for a 2+ days rather than 1 day"
	- Like, "cool, I've finished this draft, I'll return to it over the next few days and add more nuance and etc"
	- Like, "cool, I've got the A roll for this video, now I want to add some B roll, make some music for it, re-film some bits in different locations", etc
- I think it's as simple as that. No need for any big pivots here, just more time spent, more time to percolate
