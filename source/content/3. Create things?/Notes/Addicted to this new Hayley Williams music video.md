- Super addicted to this, watched it a bunch of times today (I think the music video adds a lot to the song)

- Ego Death At A Bachelorette Party
- Setting a 5 minute timer to quickly write about this
## Hypnotic
- I love how repetitive it is. There's a hypnotic quality that I find really compelling. The way on the chorus she sounds pretty much exactly the same 4 times, it feels like a chant to reassure herself,

> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up, can only go up

And then she repeats again but with this kind of unsettling new tone where she slides between the notes, I love it

But also, the verses are repetitive and hypnotic too

> I'll be the biggest star  
> At this racist country singer's bar  
> No use shooting for the moon  
> No use chasing waterfalls

> I'm the biggest star  
> At this racist country singer's bar  
> No use shooting for the moon  
> No use chasing waterfalls

Like, it's "repetitive, hypnotic verse x2, then repetitive, hypnotic verse x2"

Kinda reminds me of the final song on Fiona Apple's "Fetch The Bolt Cutters" where she repeats:

**Fiona:**

> On I go, not toward or away  
> Up until now it was day, next day  
> Up until now in a rush to prove  
> But now I only move to move

Many times, very "reassuring myself", meditative vibes
## High conviction artist
- I think she's really "high conviction" in the music video in a way that's super compelling. Like, no self awareness, total aura, total confidence

- *Ughhhh, I got nerd-sniped trying to add gifs here, tried making them and they were way too big* 
- Anyway, there's a scene where she's with someone who is clearly aware that he's on camera and he's trying to do a cool weird dance like her but is clearly very much in "am I doing it right" mode and this self-conscious like "looking out the corner of my eye at her, and also wearing this big smile that's a little forced to look like I'm comfortable and having fun", vs she's just totally in it and total conviction no eye movements just totally locked in 
- ðŸ‘‡ this bit

- Fuck it here's the voice note I sent to my friends I need to get ready for bed

- Is "full conviction mode" the same as [[Max aura]] mode?
## Vs Wet Leg - lower conviction

- I love this btw - never listened to them before, CPR (song 1) is great but song 2 (Mangetout) is *so good* â†’ the band sound so tight, the group vocals ruleeee

# Thur 2025-08-07
- *I was thinking about it more on a walk just now*
## It's uhhh kind of postmodern or something
- Ok postmodern is almost certainly not the correct thing 
- I want to point at the fact that - I really like how the song feels kind of like a puzzle, where you need the title to fully understand it
	- (Maybe this happens all the time, it just feels salient with this song - I'm still weirdly obsessed with it right now)
- "Ego death at a bachelorette party" connects the dots for you. And it's a great title, and still leaves unanswered questions
	- Did this actually happen to her? Is this a hypothetical? Is it an extrapolation of a real event in her life?
## Immediate clash of title and verse 1
- It's called "ego death..."
- And the first verse is *very* egoic

> I'll be the biggest star  
> At this racist country singer's bar  
> No use shooting for the moon  
> No use chasing waterfalls

- It's written from a part ([[Writing from the POV of "parts"]]) which is pure ego, and one I'm very familiar with - "everyone is looking at me, everyone is impressed by me, I'm the biggest star here"
- Total clash with the title! But then!

> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up from here
> Can only go up, can only go up

- I love this because *we're not told what happened*
- Suddenly, there's a complete reversal. From complete narcissistic egoic bliss, to absolute rock bottom. It's jarring
## Reminds me of the end of Infinite Jest
- There's a narrative device that DFW uses where things happen *off screen*, and it's up to you to infer, or invent, what happened
- She doesn't tell us what happened, there's some unnamed bridge from verse to chorus, some calamitous event
	- And of course, maybe the title of the song is that bridge
- Similar to the end of Infinite Jest, which actually happens after the events of the final page, you have to kind of project out and connect the dots yourself
## Visual aesthetic pairs really well with the song
- This grainy lofi camera footage
- Being high conviction (high ego?) on the streets of (somewhere in the US, idk where)
- Like, full main character mode, causing mischief on the streets 
- There's kind of two characters too? We see her as herself, and also as with much more makeup on, doing this kind of robotic thing with her face. Could this be ego death her? Because she's much more energetic and confident and normal when she has the normal makeup, and then she's glazed and glassy eyed and dissociated when she has more makeup on, maybe? (I've watched it like 10x times now, lol)
