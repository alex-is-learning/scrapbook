- From October 2024 to January 2025 I made something like 40 Youtube videos
- It was really fun! 
- It's now 2025-08-23 and I'd like to dust off the ol' Youtube channel some time soon...
## Music
- I'm not very good at making music, but it was really fun
### Vids where I rank my songs
- [I did "Steal Like An Artist" for a week & I get it now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bukMESdhZ_U)
