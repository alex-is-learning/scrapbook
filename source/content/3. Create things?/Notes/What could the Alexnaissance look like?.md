# My *ahem* "creative journey"

Early today I was walking down the hospital corridor and was suddenly struck by the thought of "oh wow, yeah, there was a time when I was scared to tweet because... I guess I thought my thoughts didn't matter enough, or something"

Now tweeting feels so obviously fun and worthwhile

And I've had similar arcs, it's multiple "0-to-1" events. And after a while you forget that you once lived in the 0, in having never done x thing:
- "I haven't tweeted into the void before" → got up to 700 followers (before getting frickin [suspended](https://substack.com/home/post/p-145712748))
- "I have never written a ==blog post==" → "I have now written and published a blog post (and a few people liked it!)"
	- "[Paper journaling is better, actually*](https://alexislearning.substack.com/p/paper-journaling-is-better-actually)" → 7th September, 2023
- "I have never made a ==youtube video==" → "I have now made youtube videos"
	- "[Vlog from France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVj4atzGWzA)" (17th Feb 2024)
	- "[Morning 1 in Toronto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0koKj6EvATg)" (23th May 2024)
	- "[idk wtf i'm doing with my life hehehe hahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXpL2r7luxQ)" (26th Oct 2024)
- "I have never made ==music== before" → "I have now made ~50 'songs'"
	- "[Ranking the 23 songs I made in 23 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGNxfy_3RVI&t=1s)" (2nd Nov 2024)
	- [Fog song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBFH-MEDuyQ), [Harmonising by mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvD2Lq1Xvvg), [I don't want to be alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGccVHbyYrY), [Mid song don't watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9ahAfMKqU0)
- "I haven't really written anything like idk ==prose-y== as an adult" → [[01. To be a boomer]], [[02. Don't be overwhelmed!]], [[03. To be a tpot zoomer]] etc

# Nice, now what
- So this is really cool, I feel like I've gotten to a place of unblocking various fears around putting stuff out there
- And I think I've also had some updates re: how to make "art", what it looks like[^1]

[^1]: - E.g. even recently I realised that it's "ok" to write from the point of view of parts of yourself. I felt a tension during my "making songs and youtube videos" era where I'd feel self conscious re: missing out nuance, and I'd constantly want to water down my stuff and add like, meta-commentary, etc
		- Vs something like [[01. To be a boomer]] which is like, not a mode that I want to live from, but cathartic
		- There's something here about the quantity of information that you can fit into song lyrics is *very* low (vs say an essay), and of course you'll have to inhabit some reductive takes, that's just a table-stakes thing that everyone is
