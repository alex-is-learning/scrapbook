# Initial notes from the ORI discord
- "My research project is -- can I heal my family?"
- It feels like the typical "healing" journey involves leaving, doing various psychotechnologies, asserting boundaries, countering alexithymia & left-hemisphere capture, etc
	- *E.g., see [Amanda Ngo's "Sherpa"](https://sherpa.onrender.com/) (collection of healing journeys)*
- *& Sasha Chapin's "[How I Attained Persistent Self-Love, or, I Demand Deep Okayness For Everyone](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love)" & "[10x happiness increases are possible, and this is an underrated fact](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/10x-happiness-increases-are-possible)"*
- It feels radically easier to disappear and work on yourself, than to try and heal your family from within
# Such an obvious project!
- This feels like a "smack yourself on the forehead and exclaim 'of course!!!'" thing - such an incredibly obvious problem, in hindsight
- Coming from a family where 
	- ~every family member is moderate-to-severe traumatised (in the Sasha Chapin "steelman of trauma" sense
	![[Pasted image 20250104155021.png]]
	- This is top of mind for me pretty much always, especially when I go on walks, especially as I'm living with family right now so I'm really *in it* 
	- Thinking about helping has always just felt so intractable 
	- But, this is clearly such a profound thing. To get my family to a happier place would be a huge source of pride and happiness for the rest of my life, a really profound project
# Very difficult! 
- (Or, maybe there's an "easy" path, but it feels very difficult to find, and very easy to fall off the path and make things worse)
- I can imagine this being a very novel, and deeply impactful project, if I pull it off
- I have this image of a very dangerous, hard-to-navigate territory, where there is a genuine path out there that leads to an oasis, but it's very very difficult to know the way
- I want to make sure I plan _diligently_ rather than being rash, because I have a sense that there are mistakes you can make in this space that make further progress much much harder
- (E.g., triggering a family member to the point where they are much less likely to be able to receive any input from you in the past)
