# Open question 1. Can this be done?

# Open question 2. *How* can this be done?
- E.g., can you be a coach for a family member, if they don't want to be helped? 
- Do you need to be radically impartial, be a beacon of light, just love people?
# Open question 3. How to help a family member?
- The problem is that when they are very sensitive/stubborn, any hint of a suggestion or wanting to help can lead to them totally shutting down. But I have a sense that this is a skill issue on my part!
# Open question 4. How to model a family?
## A model of my family
- I've been working on a few slide decks and a big Miro board to get my head around things here
- It feels very complicated atm, but I imagine there's a real front-loading thing at play where in <50 hours (and that's probably being very conservative!) I'll have reached some real initial clarity re: what's going on
- I imagine the field of "family systems" will have useful stuff
- Also complexity science, imagining a family as a complex adaptive system, systems thinking
	- "Thinking in Systems: A Primer" has the stuff about systems, stocks, flows, etc. This, but for each family member's mental health, inflows and outflows?
# Open question 5. Order of operations?
- Project 1 = mapping 
- Project 2 = figuring out how to skilfully intervene/help
- AKA problem space, then solution space?
