- [[Ship It Week log]]

- Ahhhhhhhh what a shitty day, lol.

- My macbook pro died yesterday! It just fucking died!!! What the absolute fuck!!!!
- I was walking along with it and it was working fine and it died. Figured "huh maybe the battery died?", plugged it in a bit later, and it would make the "power on" noise and the screen would turn on, but would only be black. And the touch bar would never turn on. The keyboard lights would come on after like 15 seconds
- didn't have time or energy to finish this
