- Parent page - [[David Foster Wallace (parent page)]]
## Film: "the end of the tour"
- Probably in my second year of uni, when I was ~19 (so, essentially 10 years ago)
- [[Circumstantial luck]] → a friend at university put on the film "[[The End of the Tour]]", which introduced me to David Foster Wallace. 
## Oblivion
- I then borrowed a copy of [[Oblivion]] from the university library and fell in love with his writing *immediately*
	- [[Why do I love DFW's fiction so much?]]
## Interviews
- Then I watched/listened to every interview I could find
	- This was during my first (terrible!) post-university job 
	- Shoutout to the [[David Foster Wallace Audio Project]]
	- And the [[Manufacturing Intellect (youtube channel)]] 
## Infinite Jest
- And I read Infinite Jest (twice!)
## Non-fiction
- His non-fiction never quite did it for me. Like e.g., the cruise story is good, but it just doesn't hit the same. Federer moments, Big Red Son, etc, it's whatever. I guess it's mostly intellect, much less heart? E Unibus Pluram too
## The Pale King
- I've only read this once, and it's of course unfinished - my sense was that it's a little dull, and hard to track, but there are moments are real beauty. The scene with the titular character and a woman in a diner where he listens to intently to her life story that he levitates a few inches off the chair. The whole short story about the "wastoid" stoner guy who discovers the importance of... civic duty? And becomes an IRS man? 
- I think the themes are incredibly interesting and of the times (instead of focusing on entertainment, as he did in Infinite Jest, he's focusing on boredom, mundanity, sacrifice, etc.). I should really read it again 👀
## This is Water
- [[What "This is Water" means to me (WIP)]]
