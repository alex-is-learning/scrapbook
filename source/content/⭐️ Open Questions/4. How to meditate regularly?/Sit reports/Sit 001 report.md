- [[Meditation log]]
- **Date & Time:** 2025-07-27
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
- **Summary of the Sit:** 
    - God awful, lmao. Like 99.9% distracted.
    - But, was incredibly easy to sit for the full hour - didn't have a single thought of "maybe I'll stop now", thanks to the timelapse accountability
- **Key Takeaway / Question:** 
    - Just keep going! This "monkey mind"/waterfall mind part is just the worst part. I've progressed beyond this point before!
# Timelapse!
- Vibe coded a thing to take a photo of me every 5 mins
	- https://github.com/alex-is-learning/meditation-timelapse/tree/main
- With timestamps to prove that I did the full time
- Workflow is "message my friends that I'm gonna sit for an hour and if I fail I pay them £10 each", then share the gif as proof
- Made sitting for 1 hour exponentially easier, so good
