- "The program: build your own neighborhood campus"
	- In our program, crews of 2–4 founders do a 6-week bootcamp. The crews meet weekly online to receive step-by-step guidance to **launch a neighborhood campus—complete with a weekly event, a coliving house, and community-run university by the end of the program**. The program culminates in a public demo day where each crew presents these three components of their fractal and invites others to join.
- Gather a team of 2-4 founders, pay $600 each, do this ☝️
