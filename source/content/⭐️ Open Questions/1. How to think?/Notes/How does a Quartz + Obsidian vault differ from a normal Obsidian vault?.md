# 1. Folder structure
- ![[source/content/📎 Files/Images/guides/How does a Quartz + Obsidian vault differ from a normal Obsidian vault?.png]]
- Difference 1 is that folder structure matters more
- If you want a note to appear on your (front-end) website, you need to make sure it lives in the "content" subfolder
- This is also the case for images!
- My "content" folder looks like this:
	- ![[How does a Quartz + Obsidian vault differ from a normal Obsidian vault? 1.png]]
# 2. Website home-page
- The home page's file name is index.md
- I can't remember if this is by default, or if I did this → I recommend setting the title and alias to "Home Page", so it's easier to get to via Command + O
- ![[How does a Quartz + Obsidian vault differ from a normal Obsidian vault?-1.png]]
	- (It seems that that are multiple files called index, so searching for "index" doesn't reliably get you to your home page, whereas if you set the alias to "Home Page", you will reliably get there via Command + O)

# 3. If you change the folder names, your old links will break
- This one is slightly annoying
- If I have a file in a folder called "Open Questions", and I share the URL with a friend, but I then change that folder to be called "⭐️Open Questions", the URL will now be different, and the old link will no longer work
# 4. Changing the aesthetic is trickier
