I don't think any third party plugins are essential
- There are many third-party plugins available via the settings menu
- ![[Basic Obsidian guide-7.png]]
- I think the only one that is really useful for this setup is "Paste Image Rename" by Reorx
- ![[Basic Obsidian guide-8.png]]
- It's a very simple one, it just means that when you paste an image into Obsidian, a modal pops up asking you what to name this file, which makes it easier to find later (e.g. if you want to reuse the image). As I used to have loads of images called like "screenshot-[timestamp]"

- As you can tell, this is pretty non-profound! Feel free to skip entirely
- And of course, feel free to browse the third party plugin section in the menu if you want. But I'd say you don't really need anything in there
### Some others I use
- You actually will need the git plugin for Quartz to work
- I recommend "scroll offset" to ensure that Obsidian auto-scrolls for you (so you're not staring at the very bottom of your screen when you type) (there's a typewriter plugin that does a similar thing)
