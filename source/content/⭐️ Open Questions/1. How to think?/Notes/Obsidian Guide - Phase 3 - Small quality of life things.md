## 1. Essential keyboard shortcuts/features
- Command/control + N = new note
- Command/control + O = open/search file name
- Command/control + P = "command palette"
	- This is really useful! It opens the command palette which you then type commands into. 
	- It has auto-complete, so you don't have to type the whole command, just use arrows and enter to complete
	- E.g., 
		- `light` or `dark` to change modes. 
		- `toggle left sidebar`, `toggle right sidebar`
		- `change theme`
		- `delete current file`
		- `open settings`
		- `split right` - opens the same note in another view on the right-hand side
	- Etc! Basically, if you want to do the software engineer's ideal thing of using the mouse as little as possible, the command palette is your friend
- Connect one page to another with the `[[double square brackets]]` notation
- When the cursor is inside a `[[backlinked page]]`
	- Command + O opens the page in a new tab
	- Option + O opens the page in the current tab
## 2. File browser
- If you're just using Obsidian, I recommend not even caring about this. 
- You can put your files in folders, but it's not worth the hassle IMO

- (If you're using Quartz, you just have to make sure that files live in the "content" folder)

## 3. Third party plugins
- To make Quartz work, you'll want the "git" plugin - other than that, none are essential
- I'll write a bit more about them here, hiding in a subpage because it's optional!

## 4. Setting up some hotkeys
- This is optional, but the final step for me personally to have things be easy to navigate via the keyboard
