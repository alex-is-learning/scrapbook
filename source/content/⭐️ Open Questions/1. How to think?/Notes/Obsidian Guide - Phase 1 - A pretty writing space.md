## 01. Installing Obsidian
- Download it here https://obsidian.md/
## 02. Create a vault 
### What is a vault?
- A vault is essentially a single Obsidian instance. 
- You can have multiple vaults, and they don't talk to each other - they're separate. 
- Each vault can be set up differently, e.g., different aesthetic theme, etc
- The "common wisdom" is that you should only have 1 Obsidian vault. I have recently decided that this is totally wrong! I have:
	- A new one for my contractor job
	- One called "2025" which is kind of a chaotic dump
	- One for this website
	- Etc
- I think separation of concerns is very nice for reduced cognitive load)
	- You can have a different theme for each vault, so you automatically know where you are. I find this to be very nice
- However, for the purposes of this guide, we're just making one vault
### Ok so, a fresh vault
- Tada, here's a fresh vault

- As you can see, it's very plain looking. 
## 03. Choosing a theme
- I'd recommend choosing a nice theme!
- Unlike the website front-end (Quartz), where I don't care about the theme, I think the Obsidian desktop theme matters, because it's what you'll be looking at as you write
- Also, unlike Quartz, where changing the aesthetic involves altering the CSS file(s) yourself, Obsidian has a built-in theme gallery - you just find one you like an install it, easy
- Press "command/control + ," to go to the **settings** (or, click the cog)
- Go to appearance → themes → manage

- Now you can browse the themes

- Here are the themes I use:
### Pink Topaz (for this website)
- ![[Basic Obsidian guide-1.png]]
- ☝️ Pink Topaz, for my website vault. I like a "light mode" theme, but hate staring at bright white, so I found this one to be a nice soft pink and sepia vibe, feels conducive to writng
### Material Gruvbox (for my 2025 vault)

### Solarized (Dark Mode)

### Prism (for my contractor job)

# 4. Write! (With markdown)
- In Obsidian, every note is .md (markdown)
- See this [formatting guide](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax)
# Note - maybe stop here!
- *The below are quality of life things*
- *But they're probably not worth bothering with until you find that your life is lacking quality due to little niggles*
- *I would probably recommend pausing here, enjoying your pretty Obsidian, and writing something*
