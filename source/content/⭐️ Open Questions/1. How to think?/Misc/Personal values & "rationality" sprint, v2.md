- Feeling really excited and kind of like "oh shit this is so cool", how I'm kind of back to where I was in Jan/Feb, but like, the next level of depth
- That was back when I was at the EA hotel doing my personal values sprint and then my rationality sprints
	- See [[My goals, values as of January 2025]]
- They were both pretty short but laid solid initial foundations, and then as soon as I landed on my first coherent story ("I want to be a high impact leader!") I felt like I was done with them and pivoted/merged with that story
- Guess what, I was wrong! So now I can return to them with a bit more wisdom, more understanding that these are long-term projects, and I've got my learning website, a learning mentor in Defender of Basic, a new learning/rationality role model/inspiration in Socrates, Vervaeke's series about Socrates, my own digital Socrates, etc
- Really feels like I'm onto some really cool shit. And back in v1 of this sprint I still felt like rationality is this LessWrong thing that felt kinda aversive still, vs now it feels like this ancient wisdom tradition going all the way back to Plato, and I've got some initial terminology from Francis Bacon, etc. Like, I actually don't have to go anywhere *near* LessWrong to learn about this stuff, if I don't want to
