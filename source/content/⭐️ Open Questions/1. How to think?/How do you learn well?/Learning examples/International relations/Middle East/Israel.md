# Session 1
- 2025-06-18
- Going to read more of Peter Wildeford's post
- I now have ~50-100 flashcards about Iran
- I still don't know that much about Israel (I've got a deep research report but I haven't read it yet)
- You know what, yeah, I think I'll read that & make some flashcards (bottom-up learning) -- not knowing much about Israel is a clear blocker atm
## Before I read the Israel report, let me write out my model & some predictions
- Israel has ~10 million inhabitants, ~9x smaller landmass than the UK, capital is Jerusalem (not Tel Aviv!)
- I think it mayyyy have been officially founded (probably a better word for this) in 1945?
	- 🤔 Israel was founded in 1945 - 60%
- There's stuff about settlers encroaching on Palestinian land
- Jewish people were given the state of Israel post-WWII, but there were already people there. Same as how post WWI the Ottoman Empire was split up and borders were drawn in such a way to lead to lots of issues. Pretty sure this has also happened in Africa, probably Asia too
	- 🤔 The state of Israel was officially created post-WWII - 90%
- Tel Aviv has a thriving tech scene, and I think Israel is pretty rich
	- Idk how I'd quantify this in a prediction...
	- "Israel is seen as one of the tech capital/startup capitals of the world?" - how do you quantify this? Tech startups per capita? % of the GDP that comes from software?
	- 🤔 Israel is in the top 10 list of "tech countries" - if I google that poorly phrased question, a reputable source will state Israel - 70%
- Israel gets a _lot_ of support from America, key strategic ally. Why?
	- Because they're a key beacon of American values (democracy) in the middle East?
	- Because they have oil? (I don't think so!) Not in significant amounts
	- Because there are lots of Jewish people in America who support Israel?
	- 🤔 Two of the top 4 reasons why Israel is a key US ally are "key beacon of US values" + "domestic support from Americans Jews" - 70%
- Netanyahu, "Bebe"? "BB"? I hear his full name said on podcasts
	- 🤔 It's not "BB" - 60%
- 🤔 Netanyahu is right wing - 90%
## The predictions
1. Israel was founded in 1945 – 60%
	1. ❌ 1948!
2. The state of Israel was officially created post-WWII – 90%
	- ✅
	- Moreover, its creation was deeply influenced by WWII, especially the Holocaust, which galvanized international support (particularly in the UN and from Western powers) for a Jewish homeland.
3. Israel is in the top 10 list of "tech countries" – if I google that poorly phrased question, a reputable source will state Israel – 70%
	- Asking ChatGPT how this stuff could be quantified:
		- Startup funding per capita
		- Startups per capita
		- Unicorns per country
		- Percentage of GDP from ICT/software sectors
		- Tech IPOs or exits per year
		- R&D spending as a percentage of GDP
		- Talent density (e.g. developers or CS graduates per capita)
		- Global Innovation Index rank
		- Presence of major tech hubs (e.g. accelerators, VC firms, startup density)
	- I'm gonna look at 
		- Startup funding per capita
		- Global Innovation Index

- VC funding per capita → top 5!
	- Really surprised to see Sweden and Switzerland so high up. And kinda surprised to see the UK in the top 6, as a Brit

- Global Innovation Index → doesn't appear!

- I'm gonna say that I got this ✅ right - 5th highest VC funding per GDP

4. Two of the top 4 reasons why Israel is a key US ally are "key beacon of US values" + "domestic support from American Jews" – 70%
	1. ✅
5. It's not "BB" – 60%
	1. ✅
	2. It's Benjamin, or "**Bibi**", so I was right that my spelling of BB wasn't right
6. Netanyahu is right wing – 90%
	- ✅ party is called Likud
## Nice, this took 25 mins
- Now I can read the Google Gemini deep research report 
- Ok, I've read a chunk of it. Will probably need 3+ hours to get my head around the history & make good flashcards. Need to get ready for my work day now, will leave it there
