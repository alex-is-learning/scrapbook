|
A civil-society organisation (CSO) is 
{{c1::any non-state, non-profit, voluntary group 
that people create to pursue shared interests, values or causes in the public sphere.}}
|
What a CSO being "voluntary" means:
{{c1::A company exists to generate profit for owners
A ministry exists because the state mandates it.
A CSO exists only because a group of people decided, “Let’s band together for this cause.”
If the members walk away—or donors stop giving—the organisation disappears.
There is no statutory charter or shareholder-value obligation keeping it alive.
|
The 4 ingredients of a CSO:
{{c1::
- Independent of government – not an arm of the state, though it may partner or lobby governments.
- Not-for-profit – surplus funds are reinvested in the mission, not distributed to owners or shareholders
- Voluntary participation – people choose to join, donate or work because they care about the aim.
- Public-interest purpose – seeks social, environmental, cultural or humanitarian benefit rather than private gain.

{{c1::H1N1}}
|
The 
(year) {{c1::2009}}

{{c1::2014-2016}}
|
Re: global health, the Ebola epidemic was described as 
{{c1::a "clarion call" for transforming global health security}}
|
The initial slow response to the Ebola outbreak was complicated by 
{{c1::poor public health infrastructure}}
and
{{c1::distrust of government and healthcare workers}}

{{c1::the need for culturally sensitive health education}} 
and 
{{c1::the involvement of community leaders to combat misinformation}}
|

|
A bilateral vaccine distribution agreement is
{{c1::One made between a vaccine developer and one other party (e.g. 1 government}}
|
Equitable vaccine distribution during the COVID-19 pandemic was hindered by 
{{c1::COVAX shortcomings}} 
and 
{{c1::bilateral agreements by wealthier countries}}
|
COVAX was a global initiative co-led by
{{c1::Gavi, CEPI and WHO}}
|
The goal of COVAX was to

{{c1::the Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF)}} 
and 
{{c1::a new WHO Pandemic Agreement}}
```
### Current Trends and Future Directions in Global Health and PPR
```
The term "One Health" recognises the interdependence of the health of
(4 things)
{{c1::humans, 
domestic and wild animals, 
plants, 
and the wider environment}}
|
In global health, FIF stands for 
{{c1::Financial intermediary fund}}
|
The FIF for PPR was established in year {{c1::2022}} 
|
FIF was established to 
{{c1::provide long-term financing 
to strengthen capabilities in low- and middle-income countries}}
|
Health equity is defined as 
{{c1::ensuring all individuals have fair access 
to opportunities to achieve 
their full health potential}}
|
In global health, UHC stands for {{c1::Universal Health Coverage}}
|
UHC is crucial for pandemics because 
{{c1::financial barriers can delay diagnosis and treatment 
exacerbating disease transmission}}
|
A study found that a {{c1::single-payer universal healthcare system}} could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives and billions in expenses during COVID-19 in the US
|
{{c1::UHC}} is recognised as the most inclusive, equitable, and cost-effective method for strengthening the resilience of health systems
|
Preventing a pandemic through {{c1::One Health investments}} is significantly more cost-effective than managing one, with a potential return on investment of {{c1::3:1}}
|
In global health, FAO stands for 
{{c1::Food and Agriculture Organisation}}
|
FAO is run by {{c1::the UN}}
|
In world health, UNEP stands for
{{c1::United Nations Environment Programme}}
|
In global health, WOAH stands for 
{{c1::World Organisation for Animal Health}}
|
A joint One Health plan of action was developed by 
(4 parties)
{{c1::The WHO 
FAO 
UNEP 
WOAH}}
|
{{c1::AMR}} is often referred to as a "silent pandemic"
|
By 2050, AMR is projected to cause up to {{c1::10 million}} annual deaths
|
Innovation in new antibiotics is lacking due to 
{{c1::lower commercial returns compared to drugs for chronic conditions}}
|
Climate change influences the distribution of disease vectors like
{{c1::mosquitoes and ticks, 
expanding their geographic range and prolonging transmission seasons}}
|
The WHO {{c1::Pandemic Agreement}} was formally adopted by consensus in 
{{c1::May 2025}}
|
A key nation that opted out of the final stages of the Pandemic Agreement was the {{c1::United States}}
|
The PABS system refers to 
{{c1::the WHO Pandemic Agreement’s “Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing” system}}
|
Under the Pandemic Agreement, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the PABS system will {{c1:make 20% of their real-time production available to WHO for rapid distribution}}
|
The Pandemic Agreement aims to 
{{c1::set up a Global Supply Chain and Logistics Network}}
to ensure 
{{c1::equitable and timely access to pandemic-related health products}}
```
### Conclusions and Recommendations
```
The Pandemic Agreement was adopted by {{c1::124}} countries, but 
{{c1::the United States opted out of the final stages}}
|
The history of global health shows an evolution from 
{{c1::the self-serving interests of colonial medicine}} 
to 
{{c1::coordinated global efforts}}
|
Global health campaigns like smallpox eradication have 
strengthened public health infrastructure 
but have also 
created vulnerabilities due to 
{{c1::reliance on vertical programmes}} and {{c1::external funding}}
|
The {{c1::Alma-Ata Declaration}} remains a powerful vision for holistic, community-centric primary health care
|
21st-century outbreaks like {{c1::SARS}}, {{c1::H1N1}}, {{c1::Ebola}} and {{c1::COVID}} served as a stress test for global health preparedness
|
The 21st-century outbreaks exposed systemic weaknesses such as 
(3 things)
{{c1::inadequate surveillance, 
fragile supply chains, 
and profound health inequities}}
|
"Health security is indivisible":
{{c1::no one is safe until everyone is safe}}
|
A key PPR recommendation is to 
{{c1::move away from episodic, emergency-driven funding 
towards sustained and predictable investment in public health infrastructure}}
|
Disaggregated data collection means 
{{c1::gathering data that is broken down into specific subgroups within a population
rather than lumping everyone together}}
|
PPR planning requires {{c1::disaggregated}} data collection and targeted interventions for {{c1::marginalised populations}}
|
UHC helps reduce transmission and mortality because 
{{c1::it ensures financial barriers do not delay diagnosis or treatment}}
|
The new Pandemic Agreement must establish mechanisms to avoid the {{c1::"vaccine nationalism"}} observed during COVID-19
