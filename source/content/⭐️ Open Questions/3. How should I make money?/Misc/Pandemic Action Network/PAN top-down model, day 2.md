# Model from 2 days of orientation
- 2025-06-25
- I've spent two days orienting (in the Boydian sense) to [Pandemic Action Network](https://www.pandemicactionnetwork.org/)
- Aim - to have a thorough grasp of who they are, what they do, what they've done, and their theory of change
- There's a lot to learn! This is not a scrappy little effective altruist org with a simple mission/not much available info → they have 5 annual reports and they've done a *lot* of amazing stuff
- I now have a neat Miro board full of visual notes about them ([slide deck of visual notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15rrsNpgGta1bJhfBIRhKg3DPcdUPFfWS-ugrwBg06F8/edit?slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178#slide=id.g36292da8d7e_0_178))

- Post-it notes indicate things that I currently don't understand/open questions, to look into later, in the Michael Nielsen "iterative deepening" way (from [[Bottom-up learning]], also [[Hermeneutic circle, hermeneutic spiral]])
- I still haven't made any flashcards, I'm going to test what I've grokked just from actively engaging with the info as I've ordered it, condensed it, adding hierarchies etc

# My model of Pandemic Action Network
## The basics
- Founded in 2020 by Eloise Todd and colleagues
- Lean team that leverages a network of other orgs
- Key civil society voice in global health, pandemic preparedness, COVID response
- Now has a network of 400+ collaborator orgs, including:
	- ~66% of collaborators are civil service organisations (CSOs), ~33% are African CSOs
	- Also think tanks, governments, charities, research groups, private sector, media
- ~70 collaborators in network in first year, now 400+
## Theory of change 
- Agile, non-bureaucratic, rapid pace
- Leverage diverse network of 400+ orgs in order to create policy documents
- Policy docs are deeply informed by diverse network
- Signal boosting - can coordinate across network to spread message(s)
- Key organiser of various things, key voice, kind of _the_ org at the middle of this hub-and-spoke model
- ![[Pasted image 20250626070432.png]]
- Led to huge outcomes like (and this is where flashcards will be useful)
	- Summits 
	- WHO things
	- Pandemic Fund
	- They really feel like the adults in the room (vs e.g. little scrappy effective altruism startups). Huge expertise, playing at the very top of the world stage, working with WHO and governments etc. Absurdly high leverage
- Also led initiatives like:
	- COVID ambassadors
	- Mask drives early in COVID
	- Getting PPE to frontline workers in Africa. Some absurd figures here like 300 million + PPE items delivered
## {NOTE TO SELF - make flashcards about outcomes!}
- Next - [[PAN orientation, day 3]]
