# WHO flashcards
- Three 25-minute pomodoros to:
	- Make a Gemini deep research report on the WHO
	- Read the deep research report ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zPW4Rka_c8jPQzEL1zPw3h01tU67VWzzMxBdrnbLOMI/edit?usp=sharing) (with Speechify, speed at 2.5x)
	- Make flashcards with Gemini 2.5 Pro and my "make me flashcards prompt", stored in text expander app espanso, accessed by typing `:flash`
	- Edit the flashcards in neovim -- AI isn't great at making flashcards yet, but it speeds up the process, reduces friction by a huge amount
	- Import flashcards into anki
	- Review the flashcards in anki, editing as needed (e.g., adding photos, adding colour to text)
	- Also making additional ones as needed
		- e.g. - realising that I don't know what "primary health care" is:
		- ![[Pasted image 20250627092239.png]]
	- Now have 61 new ones to review

```
The World Health Organisation (WHO) is the principal international authority dedicated to {{c1::global public health}}
|
The WHO's vision is 
"{{c1::a world in which all peoples 
attain the highest possible level of health}}"
|
The WHO's mission is (3 things)
{{c1::promote health}}, 
{{c1::ensure global safety}}, 
and {{c1::serve vulnerable populations}}
|
The WHO constitution was adopted in year {{c1::1948}} 
|
The WHO's broad definition of health encompasses social determinants like 
(3 things)
{{c1::education, 
housing, 
economic stability}}
|
A criticism of the WHO's definition of health is that 
{{c1::it may be expanding its scope 
beyond what it can effectively handle}}
|
The idea for a global health organisation was proposed at 
{{c1::the United Nations Conference}} 
in year {{c1::1945}}
|
The WHO is a specialised agency of 
{{c1::the United Nations}}
|
The WHO's structure as 
{{c1::an intergovernmental organisation}} 
limits its enforcement power, as 
{{c1::it relies on the voluntary compliance of member states}}
|
The WHO's central headquarters is located in 
{{c1::Geneva, Switzerland}}
|
The supreme decision-making body of the WHO is 
{{c1::the World Health Assembly (WHA)}}
|
In global health, WHA stands for 
{{c1::World Health Assembly}}
|
One of the WHO's core functions is setting global health {{c1::norms and standards}}
|
The effectiveness of the WHO's normative power is contingent on 
{{c1::the political will and capacity 
of its member states 
to implement global standards}}
|
A critical responsibility of the WHO is to lead and coordinate 
{{c1::the global response to health crises}}
|
The {{c1::International Health Regulations (IHR)}} are a legal framework
defining countries' obligations 
in managing public health events with international implications
|
In global health, PHEIC stands for 
{{c1::Public Health Emergency of International Concern}}
|
The WHO's Director-General has the authority to declare a {{c1::PHEIC}}
|
In global health, WHE stands for
WHO Health Emergencies Programme
|
The WHE faces challenges such as 
(2 things)
{{c1::
Delays in recruitment
Insufficient security support for staff in high-risk areas}}
|
A major financial challenge for the WHO is that 
{{c1::a large portion of its funding is earmarked, 
which limits flexibility in resource allocation}}
|
The WHO's response to major crises 
like Ebola and the COVID-19 pandemic 
was perceived by some as 
{{c1::"too slow"}}
|
The WHO promotes 
{{c1::PHC}} 
as the foundational approach for achieving 
{{c2::UHC}}
|
A monumental achievement of the WHO was 
{{c1::the declaration of the eradication of smallpox}} 
in year {{c1::1980}}
|
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched by the WHO in {{c1::1988}}
```
## 2 
```
The GPEI's strategy has resulted in 
{{c1::over a 99% reduction in global polio incidence}}
|
The two countries where wild poliovirus transmission may not have been fully interrupted are 
{{c1::Pakistan}} 
and 
{{c1::Afghanistan}}
|
Key factors for the success of disease eradication campaigns include 
(3 things)
{{c1::a disease reservoir exclusively in humans
effective vaccines, 
and sustained global political will}}
|
The WHO's initial response to the 
{{c1::HIV/AIDS epidemic}} 
was characterised by staff downplaying the severity of the crisis
|
{{c1::UNAIDS}} 
was created to spearhead the global HIV/AIDS response, 
partly because 
{{c1::the WHO's initial response was perceived as insufficient}}
|
The "{{c1::95-95-95}}" targets for HIV/AIDS 
aim for 
(4 lines)
{{c1::95% of people with HIV to know their status, 
95% on treatment, 
and 95% with viral suppression
by 2025}}
|
Major risk factors for NCDs include 
(5 things)
{{c1::tobacco use, 
physical inactivity, 
harmful alcohol consumption, 
unhealthy diets, 
air pollution}}
|
Preventing NCDs requires a {{c1::multi-sectoral}} approach 
that {{c1::extends beyond traditional medical interventions 
to engage with industries like food, tobacco, and alcohol}}
|
The WHO's ambitious target is to ensure 
{{c1::one billion more}} people benefit from UHC 
by 
year {{c1::2025}}
|
Despite being a strategic priority, progress towards 
{{c1::UHC}} 
has stagnated since 2015
|
In 2021, an estimated {{c1::4.5 billion}} people 
were not fully covered by essential health services
|
The WHO advocates for a 
{{c1::PHC}} approach 
as the most effective and cost-efficient way to achieve 
{{c2::UHC}}
|
The WHO {{c1::WHE}} 
works with countries and partners 
to 
{{c2::prepare for, prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks}}
|
Operational challenges for the WHE include (3 things)
{{c1::delays in recruitment, 
the absence of an integrated supply chain, 
and inadequate security support for staff}}
|
The WHO's funding is derived from two primary sources: 
{{c1::assessed contributions (ACs)}} 
and 
{{c1::voluntary contributions (VCs)}} 
|
When talking about the WHO
AC stands for {{c1::Assessed Contribution}}
VC stands for {{c1::Voluntary Contribution}}
|
WHO ACs are 
{{c1::mandatory membership dues from Member States }}
and historically have 
{{c1::covered less than 20% of the total budget}}
|
VCs constitute the vast majority of the WHO's financing, 
making up 
{{c1::81%}} 
of total funding in the 2022-23 period
|
Major VCs to the WHO include 
(5)
{{c1::The US
Germany 
The GAVI Alliance 
The European Commission 
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation}}
}}
|
The WHO's heavy reliance on 
{{c1::VCs}} 
Creates a fundamental vulnerability for the organisation
```
## 3
```
The World Health Organisation's (WHO) financial structure significantly influences its 
{{c1::operational flexibility}} and 
{{c1::strategic autonomy}}
|
WHO ACs are calculated based on 
{{c1::a country's wealth and population}}
|
(Problem)
While WHO ACs are {{c1::flexible}}, 
VCs are "{{c1::overwhelmingly earmarked}}", 
meaning 
{{c1::donors dictate how the funds are used}}
|
The earmarked nature of VCs effectively 
"{{c1::transfers power from WHO to donors}}" 
|
Earmarked funding can impede 
{{c1::swift responses in emergencies }}
and 
{{c1::complicate long-term planning}}
as 
{{c1::funds are tied to short-term donor interests}}
|
The WHO's CFE stands for 
{{c1::Contingency Fund for Emergencies}}
|
The WHO's {{c1::CFE}} has been reported as drying up"
|
A recent WHO decision aims to 
Increase {{c1::ACs}} to cover {{c1::50%}} of the WHO's base budget 
by {{c1::2030}}
|
Beyond smallpox and polio, 
the WHO has significantly reduced mortality from diseases like 
{{c1::malaria and tuberculosis}} through its programmes
|
A key strength of the WHO is its ability to strengthen health systems by
(3 things)
{{c1::improving infrastructure, 
training healthcare workers, 
and promoting robust health information systems}}.
|
The WHO's greatest strength lies in its 
{{c1::convening power}} 
and 
{{c1::normative authority}}, 
|
Critics argue the WHO's IHR framework 
{{c1::has a "lack of teeth" 
in its legal enforcement mechanisms}}
|
The commitment to 
{{c1::increase ACs to 50% of the base budget by 2030}} 
is considered the cornerstone of WHO's transformation"

# COVID response flashcards
## Make the report
- [Link to report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qM0XB46aVTsyuLhiurG08895jsNhGOzfswGotrXo8Wc/edit?usp=sharing)
	- *I love Gemini Deep Research so much*
- ![[Pasted image 20250627085924.png]]
## Initial read (with speechify)
- ![[Pasted image 20250627093727.png]]
- Read whilst listening at a relatively high speed. I find that speechify massively reduces willpower needed to read, as someone else is setting the pace (the person who is reading out loud)
## Make flashcards with Gemini
- As per [[My "make flashcards for me" prompt for AI]]
- I often chop the original PDF into multiple, so make sure that Gemini makes in depth flashcards, as often there seems to be an output limit
- So I've just exported pages 1-6, 6-10, 10-15, 15-18 and 18-21 to separate PDFs, to ensure I get thorough flashcards from each
## Put the first round of flashcards into Neovim (Neovide), & edit
- I have a .txt file called import.txt where I put flashcards to be edited
- ![[Pasted image 20250627103018.png]]
- Often need to add more line breaks to make the flashcards faster to parse
- And may need to make additional flashcards, or delete some that I already know/don't want to know
- I have the `:flash` prompt for making flashcards via AI use the "|" on a new line to separate the flashcards for my own readability & ease of editing whilst in neovim. Before importing to anki, I use a Python script to clean up the .txt file to be a format that works for Anki's import feature
## Deleting flashcards
- Here's an example of one I just deleted

```
Which activity did central banks in the US and Europe undertake 
to stabilise markets besides cutting rates
{{c1::large-scale asset purchase programmes}}
```

- I know essentially nothing about global finance, so this would be a total "orphan card" in my brain - a random card not attached to any other knowledge
- Right now I don't have capacity/interest to go deep on this topic, so it's better just to avoid it entirely until there's a more clear need
## Running my python script to convert the .txt file formatting
- From this kind of formatting:
```
What virus is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic
{{c1::SARS-CoV-2}}
|
How many deaths had COVID-19 caused worldwide by 2024 according to the report’s estimate
{{c1::18.2–33.5 million}}
|
What was the approximate direct global economic loss in 2020 attributed to COVID-19
{{c1::$7.4 trillion}}
|
```
- To this kind of formatting:
```
What virus is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic<br />{{c1::SARS-CoV-2}}
How many deaths had COVID-19 caused worldwide by 2024 according to the report’s estimate<br />{{c1::18.2–33.5 million}}
What was the approximate direct global economic loss in 2020 attributed to COVID-19<br />{{c1::$7.4 trillion}}
```
- Via this python script:
- Which I run by typing ! python3 python.py into neovide (yes, the file is called python.py, I know that's dumb as hell, lol)
```python
# Python script to preprocess a text file for Anki import.
#
# How it works:
# - Reads an input file (e.g., 'import.txt').
# - Assumes flashcards in the input file are separated by a pipe symbol '|'.
# - Content for a single flashcard can span multiple lines.
# - Converts each flashcard into a single line in the output file (e.g., 'output.txt').
# - Internal newlines within a flashcard are replaced by '<br />' for Anki.
# - Clears the input file upon successful output.

def preprocess_anki_text(input_filepath, output_filepath):

    """
    try:
        with open(input_filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f_in:
            content = f_in.read()
        print(f"Successfully read '{input_filepath}'.")
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Input file '{input_filepath}' not found. Make sure it's in the same directory as the script.")
        return
    except Exception as e:

            for card in processed_cards:
                f_out.write(card + '\n') # Write each processed card on a new line
        print(f"Successfully processed file. Output saved to '{output_filepath}'.")
        print(f"You can now import '{output_filepath}' into Anki.")
        print("Remember to 'Allow HTML in fields' in Anki's import settings.")

        # Now, clear the input file
        try:
            with open(input_filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f_in_clear:
                f_in_clear.write('') # Write an empty string to clear it
            print(f"Successfully cleared the input file: '{input_filepath}'.")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error clearing the input file '{input_filepath}': {e}")

    except IOError:
        print(f"Error: Could not write to output file '{output_filepath}'. Check permissions.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing file '{output_filepath}': {e}")

# --- Script Execution ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define the input and output filenames
    # The script expects 'import.txt' to be in the same directory as this script.
    # The output file 'output.txt' will also be created in the same directory.
    input_filename = 'import.txt'
    output_filename = 'output.txt'

    print(f"Starting preprocessing for Anki...")
    print(f"Input file: {input_filename}")
    print(f"Output file: {output_filename}")

    preprocess_anki_text(input_filename, output_filename)

```
- The above looks for a file called import.txt, cleans it up, saves the output to output.txt, and wipes import.txt so it's empty and ready for future flashcards
- All the files need to be in the same directory:
