- **1-paragraph manifesto 2025-08-23** â†’ I've mostly lived alone of with family since my big breakup in Sep 2022. My lack of in-person community is clearly kinda ridiculous, and needs addressing! It's tempting to be like "oh I know, I need to learn about nonviolent communication, I need to learn Authentic Relating", but I think really, step 0 is "live with (or at least near!!!) great people"
