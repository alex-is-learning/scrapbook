# What makes something a Fractal thing?
- Like, what would make it a Fractal group-house, rather than a group-house? 
- Need to read up more about Fractal, watch that talk, etc
- Toby *et al*. have founded Fractal London recently, right?
# NYC is the OG, and has multiple group houses
- 75+ residents, 22 apartments & townhouses, 4 neighborhoods, 5 "third spaces" 
# How to build your own Fractal "campus"

- "The program: build your own neighborhood campus"
	- In our program, crews of 2–4 founders do a 6-week bootcamp. The crews meet weekly online to receive step-by-step guidance to **launch a neighborhood campus—complete with a weekly event, a coliving house, and community-run university by the end of the program**. The program culminates in a public demo day where each crew presents these three components of their fractal and invites others to join.
- Gather a team of 2-4 founders, pay $600 each, do this ☝️
