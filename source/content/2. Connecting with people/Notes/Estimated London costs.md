Of course. Moving into a group house in London is a classic experience! Your initial list is a great starting point. Let's break it down in more detail to build a clearer picture of the potential costs for 2025.

I'll split this into the two main categories you mentioned: one-off setup costs and ongoing monthly costs.

### 1. One-Off Setup Costs (Per Person)

This is often the biggest financial hurdle. Before you even start paying monthly rent, you'll need a significant amount of cash upfront.

- **Security Deposit:** This is the largest single cost. By law, this is capped at **5 weeks' rent**.
    
    - If your room is `$Â£850$/month`, your share of the deposit will be approximately `$Â£980$`.
        
    - (`$Â£850 \times 12 \text{ months} / 52 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = Â£980.77$`)
        
    - This is held in a government-approved tenancy deposit scheme and is returned at the end of your tenancy, minus any deductions for damages.
        
- **First Month's Rent:** You'll need to pay this in advance before you move in.
    
    - Example: `$Â£850`
        
- **Holding Deposit (Optional but common):** To take a property off the market while referencing checks are done, you may be asked for a holding deposit, capped at **1 week's rent**.
    
    - Example: `$Â£196`
        
    - This amount is then deducted from your first month's rent, so it's not an extra cost, but it is money you need available immediately.
        
- **Furniture & Household Essentials:** This varies wildly depending on whether the room/house is furnished and what you already own.
    
    - **Unfurnished Room:** A bed frame, mattress, wardrobe, and desk could cost anywhere from `$Â£300$` (sourcing from Facebook Marketplace, Gumtree, charity shops) to `$Â£1000+$` if buying new.
        
    - **Shared Household Items:** Even in a furnished house, you'll likely need to chip in for shared items. A "house startup pot" of `$Â£50 - Â£150$` per person is a good idea. This covers:
        
        - Kitchenware: A good pan, knives, more mugs, a toaster, a kettle.
            
        - Cleaning Supplies: Hoover, mop, initial supply of sprays, cloths, etc.
            
        - Decorations: Lamps, plants, art to make it feel like a home.
            

**Estimated Total Setup Cost (Per Person):** `$Â£1,500 - Â£3,000+` This is largely dependent on the monthly rent and furniture needs. It's a significant sum to have ready.

### 2. Ongoing Monthly Costs (Per Person)

Your estimate of `$Â£1500-Â£2000$` is a reasonable range, but it really depends on location and lifestyle. Let's refine the categories.

#### **A. Housing & Bills**

- **Rent:** This is your biggest variable. Your `$Â£700-Â£900$` range is possible, but increasingly found in Zones 3/4 and further out, or for a smaller double room. A more typical 2025 breakdown for a decent double room in a house share might be:
    
    - **Zones 4-5:** `$Â£750 - Â£950`
        
    - **Zone 3:** `$Â£850 - Â£1,100`
        
    - **Zone 2:** `$Â£950 - Â£1,300+`
        
- **Bills:** Your `$Â£75-Â£150$` estimate is a good ballpark, but let's break it down. For a typical 3-4 person house, per person costs would be:
    
    - **Council Tax:** This is often forgotten! It depends on the property's value band and the borough. It can be a significant cost. Check the specific borough's rates online. Budget for **`$Â£40 - Â£70$`** per person.
        
    - **Gas & Electricity:** Energy prices are volatile. A safe budget would be **`$Â£50 - Â£90$`** per person. This will be higher in winter.
        
    - **Water:** Relatively stable. Around **`$Â£10 - Â£20$`** per person.
        
    - **Broadband:** A fixed cost. Usually **`$Â£10 - Â£15$`** per person for a good speed.
        
    - **TV Licence:** `$Â£169.50$` per year per household. If you watch live TV (on any channel) or use BBC iPlayer, you legally need one. This works out to **`$Â£3 - Â£5$`** per person per month, depending on the number of housemates.
        
    - **Total Bills (Per Person): `$Â£115 - Â£200$`** is a more realistic range.
        

#### **B. Personal Spending**

- **Food / Groceries:** Your `$Â£200-Â£400$` range is spot on.
    
    - **`$Â£200-Â£250$`** is achievable if you cook most meals at home, do a weekly shop at a budget supermarket (like Lidl or Aldi), and pack your own lunch.
        
    - **`$Â£300-Â£400+`** is more likely if you buy lunch at work a few times a week, get takeaways, and shop at places like Sainsbury's or Waitrose.
        
    - **Household Pot:** Many houses have a shared pot of `$Â£20-Â£30$` a month per person for essentials like loo roll, cleaning supplies, cooking oil, and salt.
        
- **Transport:** This depends entirely on where you live and work. Transport for London (TfL) has daily and weekly caps on contactless/Oyster payments.
    
    - **Monthly Cap (2025 estimate):**
        
        - Zones 1-2: `~Â£156`
            
        - Zones 1-3: `~Â£184`
            
        - Zones 1-4: `~Â£225`
            
    - **Cycling/Bus:** If you can cycle or rely solely on buses (`$Â£1.75` per journey, with a daily cap of `$Â£5.25`), your costs could be much lower, maybe **`$Â£40 - Â£80$`** a month.
        
- **Socialising, Hobbies & Shopping:** This is the most personal category.
    
    - A pint: `$Â£6 - Â£7.50`
        
    - A casual restaurant main: `$Â£15 - Â£25`
        
    - A cinema ticket: `$Â£10 - Â£18`
        
    - A realistic "going out" budget could be anything from **`$Â£150`** to **`$Â£500+`** a month.

### Putting It All Together: Example Monthly Budgets

**Scenario 1: "Frugal but Realistic" (e.g., Zone 3/4)**

- Rent: `$Â£850`
    
- Bills: `$Â£130`
    
- Food: `$Â£250`
    
- Transport (Bus/some Tube): `$Â£100`
    
- Socialising/Misc: `$Â£200`
    
- **Total: `Â£1,530/month` ðŸš¨
    

**Scenario 2: "Average London Experience" (e.g., Zone 2/3)**

- Rent: `$Â£1,000`
    
- Bills: `$Â£150`
    
- Food: `$Â£350`

Your initial guess was very good! The main things to be prepared for are the huge upfront setup cost and ensuring your bill estimates include Council Tax, which is a big one. Good luck with the planning!
