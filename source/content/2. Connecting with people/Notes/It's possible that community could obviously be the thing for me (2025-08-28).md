- [[Alex and Simmo group house, parent page]]
- 2025-08-28
- **Epistemic status**: this is a very profound and deep topic for me, kind of *the* key topic in my life so far, and I know that I won't be able to explain it well right now. I'm giving myself permission to write a quick, incomplete thing here
# The feeling of "I don't have preferences"
### Just happy to be here
- A key failure mode for me has always been being (as a friend described it) "==just happy to be here==". 
- *(Maybe it's not a failure mode, maybe it is a genuine and nice way to be (or maybe a bit of both))*
- I have a sense that I did have such a relatively bad time (with e.g. social anxiety and childhood stuff etc), that I genuinely am just pleased when I have some friends to talk to and etc. 
- Like, I don't want for much, and I'm satisfied with a small amount, "this is already great". Especially post-kensho, just like "holy shit, this rules". 
- Like, I don't currently have a 1/3/5 year plan, I don't have any big clear ambitions other than vague and intuitive day-to-day stuff[^1]
### Having never experienced [the good thing]
- Also, at 29, I have ==never lived in a good group house==, to have been too socially anxious during uni/masters. 
- So there's the "[[Ignoti nulla cupido]]" thing here too â†’ maybe I'd love it, but I've never experienced it, so it's not an active desire for me right now, other than in an abstract sense. All I know is what I've lived[^2]
### Wanna form a group house? 
- So, when Simmo says "wanna form a group house?", I'm like "==hell yeah, of course==, I've been job hunting and living at my mum's for 6 months to cut costs, of course I'd like to live in a group house, that'd be a huge improvement". 
- "And also I've never lived in a good group house and I really like you and we've been friends for 2+ years with lots of growth and conflict resolution and there's a depth of trust here" and etc. So yeah, a group house with Simmo is a no-brainer IMO
### Wanna form an *intentional community*?
- And when he's like "what about an ==intentional community==", I'm like, "idk about that, sounds more like your dream than mine, I just want the bare minimum of a nice group house, that's a huge like 1000x improvement already, I don't really see the point of thinking about like 10,000x or 100,000x improvements atm, seems too ambitious and had to parse"
	- (*Which is silly on my part, like, that's scope neglect right there. But still, you know, I'm talking about gut/intuition/felt sense, rather than like logic, reasoning*)
- So my gut sense was like "idk about *Fractal*, idk about *community*, idk about like *forming a community hub and campus where people teach each-other*, that all seems like much more than I need right now. And I know that you've lived in great communities so you have much more of a real want for all that stuff, but I have the *ignoti nulla cupido* thing, I just don't know, no non-propositional knowledge here
# But!
- But actually, guess what, I think actually I could be someone who is really really energised by an amazing community, because ==it literally solves things that I have been pretty much obsessed with==, and a serial ruminator about, for years
- This is something that is very alive for me atm because I've just lived with my mum for ~6 months and just spend 2.5 weeks being the only person helping my Dad in a Spanish hospital, so I feel very attuned to some stuff
## Boomers/family/parenting
- A key thing for me, really possibly *the* thing in my life, the key theme, is the whole like "holy shit, my family is so ~damaged, ==no one is doing well==, it's gradually drifting apart and no one has the emotional skills to do conflict resolution, my parents are not doing well (from being working class and growing up in a time pre-therapy etc)"
- Having parents who are the opposite of lifelong learners, who are stuck in "fixed mindset", who have ==no agency== at all, who are the Romeo Stevens thing of like "most people are tactically smart and strategically incredibly stupid" (because they can e.g. book a holiday, but they can't look at the ==trajectory of their life== and realise how fucked they are if they don't make some profound changes)
	- See e.g. [[01. To be a boomer]]
	- & [[Tactically clever, strategically stupid]]
- This is the key theme of my life really. There has been ==huge bitterness== re: "I can't believe this is my family, I can't believe these people are my 'role models', this is so fucked, there are no adults in the room", and despair that they won't help themselves
	- It's partly why I'm like "I can't deeply care about Effective Altruism, my family are suffering!" (or, "my house is on fire!")
### Moloch
- And this is all downstream of society failing them, really. They didn't have therapy, there are no clear paths forwards for them that are straightforward. My parents parents were all very difficult, working class, traumatised. They didn't have religion to fall back on, or a healthy community, no role models, etc
- By Moloch I mean this [blog post](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) by Scott Alexander re: imagining the kind of fucked up state of the world as being about perverse incentives and this inhuman demon/god that we summon by mistake (or something like that)
## "What do I do with all of this?"
- I haven't known what to do with all this energy, my horror at the way various family members live, all the energy it has given me to e.g. learn to learn, learn to think, refuse to get stuck in a rut, etc
- I don't want to abandon them, I also don't want to try to save them 
	- (Which I tried to do briefly re: going to family therapy with my mum, e.g. [["How can I change how to orient to my family?" (Open Question)]])
# Because it feels intractable, I ~forget about it 
- There's a sense in which, all this stuff being so important to me, so salient, has actually blocked it from my awareness in a weird way. It's like an [ugh field](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields) or a blind spot
- Like, it's so aversive, so I don't know what to do about it, so I look elsewhere, and I think that there's nothing that can be done, and I kind of *forget about it*, or at least I ==never do the mental move of "this is an important thing for me to work on"==
# "I don't know what my thing is"
- And as such, I can tell myself "oh man, I don't know what my thing is, I don't know what my niche is, I don't know what matters to me, I just haven't found it yet, maybe one day, maybe one day I'll stumble across something like idk geology and I'll have this ==eureka moment== and realise that that is the thing for me to build my life around, but not yet, I haven't found it yet"
- Vs "I have been alive for 29 years. Imagine an omniscient being could look into my brain and all my thoughts over the last 10+ years and pull out the things that I think about the most - what might they be?"
## The negative formulation is agency-robbing, a positive reframe is obvious and energy-giving
### Being a parent
- E.g., if I think about "do I want to be a parent one day?", it's like "oh god, holy shit, it seems like it'd be so hard, and so easy to fuck up". How could I possibly do that, and it's so far away, etc
- But, if the question is "could all this mean I have a huge amount of energy and juice re: being the best Dad I can possibly be, and that would be profoundly, indescribably meaningful as it would e.g. let me 'heal' via giving my child what I wish my Dad could have given to me?", it's like, ==so incredibly obvious== that this is one of the core themes of my life
	- It's like, the **negative version** of this, the "oh man my parents really messed up in big ways" thing is agency-robbing and overwhelming. 
	- And the **positive formulation** of "therefore I want to be an incredible Dad" is incredibly energising and obvious
### Living in a non-Molochian world
- And then similarly "do I want to live in intentional community?" is like "oh man, idk, that seems far too like, grand, I don't need all that, not yet anyway"
- **Negative formulation**
	- And similarly - "man, society has failed so many of us, it's so fucked up, what the hell are my family supposed to do, what even would my prescription be to them if they did want to follow my path which I know has helped me in profound ways" is massively agency-robbing and overwhelming. I'm left with no options, it feels like there's nothing that can be done, so I just like, background it 
- Vs the **positive formulation** of "let's build a long-term community and use all the pain and failure of the default society as a deep teacher in what to not build" is very energising and obvious
# uhh the end
- "I want to be an amazing parent (and husband) one day" is possibly a very obvious goal, but lemme let it percolate somewhat
- And "I want to help build a non-Molochian community/society" is possibly a very obvious way to channel all the pain from living in this world, but again, brand new framing, let's see ðŸ‘€



[^1]: - I think this is "just happy to be here" stuff is also partially downstream of spending a good chunk of my childhood in the sanctuary of my bedroom, door shut, video games, reading Harry Potter, playing ps1 then ps2 then ps3, etc, and being shuttled back and forth from one unhappy home to the other for years, and going on holidays that I didn't want to go on, etc. If you don't have a happy home life, you're forced to dissociate a bit and just make do. "The endurer" archetype comes to mind

[^2]: What living situations have I had? 
	- Childhood, good home for first 5 years, then shitty for ~13
	- Uni â†’ holy shit I am so socially anxious â†’ lived with people who were just ok in 2nd and 3rd year, too socially anxious and low agency to e.g. propose living with the people I was closer with (but still socially anxious around)
	- Living with long-term girlfriend â†’ lovely, sanctuary, fun, great. Especially when we got our greyhound, are you kidding me dude! I owe my ex-girlfriend an astounding amount
	- Living ~alone, e.g. ~2 years of traveling post-breakup. Sublets, Airbnbs. Sometimes shared a place with people (e.g. H & C in London for a few months, Y in Toronto), but still in the mode of "mostly in my bedroom, mostly doing my own thing", which is yeah I think downstream of a childhood in my bedroom
	- Intentional community â†’ even when I lived at Life Itself, I was mostly doing stuff on my own, working, going on walks etc. For the last ~2 weeks we had a nice little group there (E + R + V), and a few really nice hangs. In fact, there was a time when I cried because of a miscommunication and me feeling uncared for, and the 3 of them all came and we talked about it and had a big hug, which felt really like the first and only time that I experienced real community. That was my first taste of what this stuff could be
