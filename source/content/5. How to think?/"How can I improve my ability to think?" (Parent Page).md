- **1-paragraph manifesto 2025-08-23** â†’ in Jan of 2025 I had the embarrassing update of "I know I've been making youtube videos about how I'm gonna make a song a day in 2025, but actually I don't wanna do it anymore", which led to me facing my "I'm not good at making rational well thought out plans, I pivot all the time, I'm the king of recency bias", etc. So, a theme for 2025 has been learning about rationality, bias, probabilistic thinking, finding more foundational values/Popperian truths, to reduce the amount of wild pivots I do.
