- *Quick and profoundly incomplete writeup:*
- I first got into this question during something like my third year of uni when I realised how bad I was at learning and how I forgot essentially everything from my lectures within 6 months
- I did the "Learning how to Learn" coursera course and that set me on the meta-learning path
- Anki flashcards
- Made this website, posted it to EA forum, offered free learning coaching, got job at Alvea
	- https://www.alexislearning.me/learning-blog-2021/
- I have lots more to say here, but will leave it there for now
	- E.g., I think visual notes are hella underrated
		- [[Are visual notes underrated and poorly understood?]]
	- I think Obsidian/Roam/second brains are very... honestly, kinda dangerous - easy to become a profound waste of time
		- I love Sasha's [Notes Against Note-Taking Systems](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems) post for this

Not only can Alex learn things quickly, but he can distill the important bits in an intuitive and user friendly way**" - [reference from Ethan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mBN-iWSwoYM8zUMU25iPGs9Glgzzq3Ps1DRWEivRiFg/edit?tab=t.0)
