- From [[Are visual notes underrated and poorly understood?]]
> I find that, once I do this in Miro, once I make a crazy cork-board and then iteratively prune and organise it, I end up in a place where I can talk fluently about the topic, without the need for flashcards. 

 > The process of pruning and organising and clarifying makes it slot into my brain, vs at the beginning of the project there's a feeling of overwhelm and a total lack of understanding of the gestalt of the thing 
 > 
 So maybe this is a form of hermeneutics, of engaging with the hermeneutic circle?
 
 > I dump all the context in Miro, I iteratively refine my understanding of different component parts, which feeds into my understanding of the whole. Then, with a better understanding of the whole, I can further reorganise and refine the component parts, deepening my understanding

From [[Bottom-up learning]] - what Michael talks about is also the hermeneutic circle, using Anki flashcards instead of Miro

> By bottom-up learning I mean learning by collecting all the more basic, essential facts, memorising them, then going up to the next level of abstraction/complexity, memorising/grokking this level, then climbing up, etc 

 > Michael Nielsen details it in his incredible [Augmenting Long-Term Memory](https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) post from his Augmenting Cognition blog:![[Michael Nielsen highlighted.webp]]
