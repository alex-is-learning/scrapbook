- Yesterday was day 1, and absolutely nobody replied to me, lol
- To be expected! There's definitely a knack to this
- Thought I'd document my interactions to like... show what I did wrong, lol

- Prediction of what I did wrong here: 
	- First of all, they're a kind big account, and have already got a fair amount of replies, so probably don't want to reply to anyone (in fact, I imagine they didn't reply to ~anyone)
	- Second, idk... I'm like, telling him a fact, I'm telling him why he's wrong... he's clearly not in like, truthseeking mode here... I'm just not doing *the thing* * that I should be doing, I think I'm missing the correct move atm

- Same failure mode as `#1` really. This isn't a truthseeking-y person (but then again, I imagine Defender could do something more skillful here)

- There's something here like... idk, they don't have an incentive to reply to me, right? Like why bother? They just wanted to vent/share their frustration

	- I think the skillful here would have been like "ugh I know right, I can't believe he says x"?
	- Vs the thing of "[It's rude to ask for cognitive labor before establishing trust](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/its-rude-to-ask-for-cognitive-labor)"

	- I think here, I'm doing the wrong thing again. I think I should be trying to agree with him, to be agreeable, to get him to confirm that my model of him is correct
	- Vs what I'm doing is kind of a "umm actually!!" thing, which is annoying

	- Another "umm, actually!" - I keep kinda trying to disprove people who I don't agree with. I think I've been misunderstanding the game here
	- I think the game is go 'yeah, totally, and the worst thing is x!', maybe?? I still don't feel clear on this...
