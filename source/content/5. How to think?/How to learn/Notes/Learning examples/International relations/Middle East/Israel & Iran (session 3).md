- Going to read a bit more of the Peter Wildeford post
	- Post from 14th June 2025: "The Fordow Paradox: Where do Iran and Israel go from here?"
# Predictions
1. US B-2 bombers are nuke-first bombers - 20%
	1. I know nuclear bombers are part of the nuclear triad, but you'd assume that B-2s would carry other types of bombs as a priority, right?
	2. ❌ nice, I was right!
		1. "The B-2 has in fact been used only in conventional combat missions so far (Kosovo 1999, Afghanistan 2001, Libya 2011, Syria 2017). Its nuclear role is primarily deterrent, not a designated “first-strike-only” platform."
2. Saudi Arabia is the #1 exporter of oil in the middle east - 80%
	1. ✅
	2. This [NASDAQ article](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/10-top-oil-producing-countries-updated-2024) says they're number 2, behind America at number 1, which is surprising to me!!
3. The answer to the heading "what does Iran want" (by pursuing nuclear) will be "leverage" - 70%
	1. Seems really obvious, maybe too obvious, hence only 70%
	- ✅
4. "The Iranian regime sees nuclear capability as solving three existential threats simultaneously"
	- Squinted as I copy-pasted this so I wouldn't see the answer, lol
	- Protection from America, Russia, Israel, other nuclear armed states
	- Leverage over non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) in the middle east, e.g. Saudi Arabia
	- Ability to enter summits etc (this was kind of given away as he described what benefits North Korea got as a result of nukes)
5. "US MOPs" - the M stands for massive, and/or the P stands for penetration - 20% 
	- ✅ damn it literally is
	- "Massive Ordnance Penetrator" - I thought that was too dumb

# Things I don't know
- Iron Dome vs David's Sling vs Arrow systems
- What leverage does Iran have?
	- If most of their air defences are destroyed, and they've depleted a lot of their weapons, & key military leaders have been killed
	- Can blockage that area in the Gulf of _ at their south border, which is where a large amount of oil infrastructure sits (pretty sure it connects to other countries to, like probably the UAE and Saudi Arabia)
- "Getting nuclear weapons →  internal dissent loses steam when opposition leaders know toppling the government might mean losing the country's nuclear umbrella against Israel and the US."
	- I don't get this - couldn't opposition leaders keep access to the nuclear weapons?
	- I guess perhaps the argument is that total regime change = loss of expertise, a period where the nukes aren't operational because the apparatus is so complicated?
