- I'm halfway through "How to Think Like Socrates" and lovingggg it
- I need a break from job stuff (it is the weekend after all), so I'm gonna read a bit about ancient Greek history because I know essentially nothing
- Got a deep research report on the [Ancient Greeks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16_jdEXDsJ1sQeR7dabMw7v9JIexnjpt3u7sIHrjtp8g/edit?usp=sharing) and another on [Socrates' Athens](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q9ceGn4e1FZ8s5nDTEMI3fvEvgbMp4lWQSFOG_YJi_g/edit?tab=t.0)
- One thing I'm already *loving* is how many Greek words explain english words. Like sophistication comes from Sophists, stuff like that. Metropolis, tyrants, oligarchs, Marathon
- Excited to learn more about Homer and Hesiod
- Also really cool to have learned a bit about Iran recently and now going back in time to see the Persian Empire showing up here. I have a biography of Alexander the Great that I'd love to read soon
- This also feels like an exciting thing to learn about because I bet there are _so many_ great youtube videos with really high production values. Similar to learning about the Roman Empire (which I know almost nothing about atm)
