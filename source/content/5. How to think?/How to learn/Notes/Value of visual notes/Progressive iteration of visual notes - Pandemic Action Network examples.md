- [[ðŸŸ£ Project - "Are visual notes underrated and poorly understood?"]]
- I've spent the last 2 days orienting to the "[Pandemic Action Network](https://www.pandemicactionnetwork.org/)", as I'm going to apply to one of their job listings
# Adding hierarchy for easier parsing
![[Meta - on making miros, visual notes.jpg]]
- Adding more hierarchy, pulling out atomic bits (vs "blocks of text")\
# End of day 1 of orienting to job at PAN
- Spent day 1 making visual notes from the info on PAN's website & a deep research report about them
- Purple post-it notes denote things that I don't understand yet, future things to look into

- Now day 2 = going through each and iteratively refining, and pulling out further questions
# The full pipeline â†’ Deep research â†’ miro â†’ visual notes
![[Pasted image 20250625204844.png]]
- Copy paste the key stuff into Miro ðŸ‘‡
![[Pasted image 20250625204859.png]]
- Put each sentence into a seperate box. This took ~30 mins. This is the part where I feel most unhinged ðŸ‘‡
- pulling out each atomic statement
- note - no hierarchy yet
- there will be lots of redundancy too, and filler/low-signal sentences

- ðŸ‘‡ Adding hierarchy
- ![[Pasted image 20250625205051.png]]
- Condensing, tidying, adding more hierarchy ðŸ‘‡

# Day 1 vs day 2
- ![[Pasted image 20250625205149.png]]
# 2 day "orientation" phase is key
- (Although maybe it can be sped up...)
- I can write a much better cover letter after properly orienting and discovering if I'm excited or not
- Get a real gestalt/grok of what they do, why they're important, why I should be excited
- ![[Pasted image 20250625205209.png]]
# End of day 2 â†’ full oriented (to the basics)
- Now I have a bunch of further questions that I can explore if I get to the next stage
