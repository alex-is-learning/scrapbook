- As a slightly unhinged experiment, I'm gonna try streaming to Twitch as I learn
- Inspired by Andy Matuschak ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG2_6ToMZgI))

## Re: tacit knowledge videos
> *Tacit knowledge is knowledge that can’t properly be transmitted via verbal or written instruction, like the ability to create great art or assess a startup. This tacit knowledge is a form of [intellectual dark matter](https://youtu.be/-KPAD1UjpsE), pervading society in a million ways, some of them trivial, some of them vital. Examples include woodworking, metalworking, housekeeping, cooking, dancing, amateur public speaking, assembly line oversight, rapid problem-solving, and heart surgery.*

## My videos

	- I guess there's something like "we remove your videos after 30 days"
	- Luckily I did download each, for posterity
	- I cba to put them on youtube right now, but rest assured, you'd have been *really* impressed. Probably the best videos on the internet
