- 2025-07-04
	- Next page in series - [[05. Learning the Socratic method, part 1 â†’ the rationale (WIP)]]
- So, I wrote up my model of the Socratic method, after reading the book 
	- ([[03. Manifesto - "Why I Should Learn the Socratic Method"]])
- What next?
# Stuff I don't remember/don't know, yet
- Looking at my notes in the margins, and anywhere where I've e.g. done a big exclamation mark
- ![[annotated-socrates.webp]]
	- *That's right, teenage me, I'm not afraid to scribble all over a book*
## Flicking through the book to surface things that I didn't know that I don't know:
### 1. On the profundity/rationale/theory of change
#### Popularity
- John Stuart Mill quotes re: Socrates
- Author's thoughts on why the Socratic method isn't popular
#### Confusion
- Stuff about *confusion* being a key focus
	- Mill: "The Socratic method, of which the Platonic dialogues are the chief example, is unsurpassed as a discipline for correcting the errors, and clearing up the confusions incident to the *intellectus sibi permissus*, the understanding which has made up all its bundles of associations under the guidance of popular phraseology" (page 19)
	- *Intellectus sibi permissus* means "the mind left to itself"
	- Commonplace as being the key enemy, rather than Sophistry
- The key importance of intellectual consistency
	- "To Socrates, this is everything"
#### Ignorance and midwifery
- Chapter about ignorance
	- Also, Buddhist moha
	- Conceits, like weeds, that block the growth of anything better
	- Irony
	- Ignorance of ignorance (double ignorance)
> "Socratic philosophy starts with a love of truth, but as a matter of *action* its first task is negative: shaking off the delusion of wisdom"
- Midwifery
	- Joe Hudson using VIEW to be the ideal midwife?
- *Ignoti nulla cupido* - this is a very profound thing to deeply grok!!!! (page 140)
	- You *are* the cattle
	- The allegory of the cave
	- "Ogle the powers of those who see farther than we do"
		- Forecasters, people with real values/concrete missions
	- "...it is the master mistake that makes all other mistakes more likely, over a lifetime and by the hour. The Socratic method is a way to correct it" - page 147, re: the invisibleness of idiocy
#### "The Socratic Function"/theory of change
- Profundity of adversarial thinking (page 49)
- The importance of (the claim of) ignorance
- What the author writes about "The Socratic Function"
- What is elenctic thinking?
	- Purgative elenchus
	- Defensive elenchus
	- Gathering knowledge via elenchus (Popper)
		- "Production of cumulative consistency"
		- First principles, strong priors, evolutionary epistemology
	- Performing surgery on yourself, heroic state
	- Ridiculousness audit
- Care of the psyche, the soul, vs confusion
- Why Socrates was obsessed with definitions (page 83)
### 2. Technique/"how to" 
- The use of concrete examples
- Systole, systolic
- Diastole, diastolic
- Platonic collection and division, diairesis, dialecticians
- Chapter on analogies
	- Also, the epagoge
- Chapter â†’ Socratic Rules for Dialogue
	- Seeking the truth (dialectic vs eristic)
	- People, not just claims
	- The priority of reason
	- Candor
	- The one-witness principle
	- Charity (steelman)
	- Offense
- Chapter on how to make first half of the elenchus
- Chapter on how to make the second half of the elenchus
#### Profundity of questions
- More on the profundity of questions ("We're at our keenest when we work on a question")
	- (Chapter 5)
	- Counters the bad habit of a love of holding opinions
	- Turns you into a scientist
#### Aporia
- Even in a state of aporia, some things remain obvious ("I still know that I have only 2 hands")
- Aporetic cleansing
- Aporetic cleansing before learning
- The aporetic spur (so good!!!)
	- A salient, bedevilling open loop
	- Vs if you have double ignorance, certainty, then no curiosity, no open loop. Hedgehog (vs fog)
- Aporia, the ineffable, the Dao etc (page 134)
- False aporia is still useful
### 3. Socratic ethics
- Socratic ethics
	- Eudaimonia is the final goal
	- "Happiness" is a good translation, if you understand the Greek version of this
	- Socratic equation
		- Happiness = virtue = knowledge
	- The impossibility of akrasia
	- Lack of need for willpower re: e.g. "resisting" heroin
	- Everyone desires good things, no one willingly does wrong
		- "They're in the grip of mistakes and bad understandings" (and so are you!!!)
### 4. Misc
- What does the word "transliterated" mean?
- Gather the various metaphors where I've scribbled "great metaphor!" in the margins
- Enneagram 3 and Socratic method (e.g. identity/image consciousness)
- Chapter on Socrates and the Stoics, and chapter on Socrates and the Skeptics â†’ don't care about this atm 
- Properly grok the different things that rhyme with the Socratic method and why (e.g., AoA's VIEW, and each of the 4 parts)
# ðŸš¨ Ok, now what? ðŸš¨
- I think I want to have a decent grokking of each of these headings
- Start with section 1 to grok the profundity & keep the motivation high (although admittedly it's already high)
