- "The thing I like to tell myself is that writing makes me feel more alive. Putting words to my thoughts brings the world into me. I'm reading a book and it's interesting, but unless I stop and actually write about it and put my own words to it, it's not going to make it into my body and become part of me; I'm not going to be transformed by it. But I want to be changed by life. I want to be affected by life. I want to grow and change. So I write."
	- Michael Nielsen: "I love this. Writing is one of the best tools for self-transformation I know. A bonus is that the higher the standards of writing you hold yourself to, the deeper the self-transformation may be."
