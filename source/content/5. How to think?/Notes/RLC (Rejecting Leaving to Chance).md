# Gemini Summary
Based on the document provided, **RLC** stands for **Rejecting Leaving to Chance**. It is presented as a conscious, active decision to live and make choices in a way that is fundamentally different from the default path of ILC (Implicitly Leaving to Chance).

Here is a summary of what Path RLC involves:

- **Core Principle**: The fundamental goal of Path RLC is to strive to reduce the role of chance in one's decision-making as much as possible. This is achieved by striving to learn at the deepest level and consistently basing one's decisions on everything learned so far.
    
- **Deep Questioning**: A person on this path actively questions the beliefs, values, and methods they were raised with. For example, instead of just using a mathematical formula because it's what they were taught, they will ask
    
    _why_ that formula is correct and seek to learn the underlying mathematics. This same questioning is applied to all areas, including ethics.
    
- **Learning in Ethics**: When it comes to ethics, someone on Path RLC questions the very foundation of their moral framework. They move beyond simply using inherited goals (like maximising pleasure) and ask whether those goals are the right ones to have. This involves exploring fundamental questions about wellbeing, virtue, and how to relate to others.
    
- **A Change in Mindset**: Even before a person on Path RLC has succeeded in learning, their mindset changes. They become someone with an open, enquiring mind who is humble and tentative in their actions, aware that their current views might be wrong and open to learning from others.
    
- **Transformation Through Learning**: As a person on this path succeeds in learning, they are transformed. Their understanding gives them a sense of confidence, security, and peace of mind because they know their actions are based on solid ground rather than chance.
    
- **An Autonomous Life**: The document suggests that taking Path RLC is how one achieves autonomy. It gives purpose and structure to life, allowing a person to build a secure foundation for themselves and live a worthwhile life based on well-grounded principles rather than contingency.
