# What is this guide for?
1. How to set up Obsidian to be a nice writing tool
		- (In a very "80/20" way â†’ I don't believe in complicated, over-engineered "knowledge management" setups, total distracting busywork IMO. Just write shit dude)
2. How to set up and Obsidian/Quartz website
## What's wrong with Obsidian "out of the box"?
- I think Obsidian is great, but out of the box it's both a little ugly and missing a few small quality-of-life things that you have to turn on
- So, let's make a brand new vault to see what it's like and what I have to set up to make it nice
## Back-end/front-end distinction
- This guide will be written for someone who wants to make an Obsidian/Quartz website. (That is, my friend Simmo, who I've been pestering to set up a digital orchard for weeks)
- You use the Obsidian desktop app as your writing tool, the "back-end" of your website
- And you set up a Quartz instance to be the "front-end" of your website
- Note this back-end/front-end distinction! E.g., if you change the theme in the Obsidian desktop app, it will not change the theme in the Quartz front-end, as they are fundamentally different tools
