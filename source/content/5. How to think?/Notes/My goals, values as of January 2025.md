- I want to do a bit of introspection re: what I'm motivated by and what I'm actually trying to achieve
- I have a sense that is already fairly figured out (for the short-term/time being, at least)
- I did a personal values sprint back in January 2025, via Schmactenberger's "[Dharma Inquiry](https://civilizationemerging.com/dharma-inquiry-2/#:~:text=Dharma%20involves%20your%20being%2C%20your,and%20express%20in%20each%20situation%3F)" questions and the [Clearer Thinking "life leverage points" diagram](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/behavioral-leverage-points-to-improve-your-life)
# My 5 Core Values
## 1. Work Ethic & Being Useful
- I'm an enneagram 3w4 ("The Professional/The Expert")
	- Enneagram type 3 wing 4’s most basic desire is to feel loved, accepted, and to be really good at something—reaching the top.
	- Enneagram type 3 wing 4’s most basic fear is to fail. They’re afraid of not discovering something new, achieving something great, or even just not living an extraordinary life.
- What’s the ~ideal dose of "work ethic/being useful"?
	- ~Full time, life being mostly oriented around work. 
	- Enneagram 3 (vs e.g. an enneagram 7 where life is oriented around socialising & novelty. Gimme projects and a feeling of competency, usefulness.)
## 2. Growth
- Growing and improving is a huge driver for me. Used to be somewhat toxic, feels much more positive these days (fission era, vs solar and fusion era). Growth and learning because those things fuckin rule. Feels like the Goggins thing of pushing yourself because you love yourself and want the best for yourself. I want to be the best version of me!  
## 3. Sincerity & Big-Heartedness
- That is, ~all my heroes are good, kind, big-hearted people
- What’s the ~ideal dose? Having EA-adjacent, tpot-adjacent friends, who are kind and care about improving the world and being good
## 4. Reducing Suffering
- I don’t know that I could just get a normie/corpo job where it’s potentially net-neutral or even net-negative for the world (e.g. management consultant). 
- With p(doom) high, with tpot knowledge and stream entry, feel a moral obligation, maybe. 
- E.g. working at Headgum (the comedy network that hosts the Headgum Podcast that I listen to daily and love), just doesn’t feel like that is the correct use of my time. I have gifts...
## 5. Charisma, Funny People, Being Funny
- What’s the ~ideal dose? Good friends + podcasts [75%]
- E.g. Tilly, Stephanie, James & Simon, podcasts
- That is - if I have funny in-person friends, that’s enough. I don’t have to work in comedy, it’s not a burning need

# ❓ Work Ethic, Being Useful, Growth - Why?
- To what end? 
## I want to be a positive force in the world
- I don't just want a normie job
## I want to help, to be helpful
- I don't want to e.g. make music or youtube videos. I want to have a tangible impact
## I want to expand my possibility space (by growing)
- I want to live up to my potential
- I don't want to be help back by a lack of knowledge, a lack of education
- E.g., I currently don't know much about the following things that could probably expand my possibility space a lot:
	- Maths beyond what I learned up until the age of ~15
		- I don't know how maths could help me, but I imagine that having better "quant" skills would be profound!
	- Software engineering, just Python & SQL
		- Similarly, I don't know what I'd do with these skills, as I think it's hard to model the use-cases when you don't know anything. But it's undeniable that the ability to build software is a very profound meta-skill, a force amplifier of other skills and interests
	- How the world works
		- Not showing up at the highest levels, not conversant with the most intelligent and agentic people, due to lack of knowledge
	- How to start and run a successful business 
		- Learning to think, learning to find untapped markets and potentials, learning to have novel contributions, learning to code, learning how the world works, I think will eventually converge into "being able to make a successful business"
# My traits

## 1. Strong personal preferences
- (Very enneagram 4!)
- Strong aesthetic preferences
	- Really really love good art 
	- Really really hate bad art (partly this is snobbishness that I can temper, but I think it's also the shadow side of loving good art)
- Strong people preferences
	- E.g. at EA Hotel -> really don't have much patience for people who I don't think are a good fit
## 2. Likeable, funny, "sparkly"

## 3. Great executive function & drive
- Simmo sees my as incredibly high functioning in this regard
## 4. Love learning

## 5. Introvert-leaning, but flexible
