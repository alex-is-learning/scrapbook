In Robert Kegan's theory of adult development, Stage 4 is known as the "Self-Authoring Mind." This stage represents a significant evolution from the "Socialised Mind" of Stage 3. While a majority of adults operate from Stage 3, a smaller portion, estimated at around 35% (with only 1% having mastered it), reach Stage 4. It marks the development of a distinct, internal sense of identity.

Here is a summary of the key characteristics of Kegan's Stage 4:

- **Internal Authority and "Self-Authorship":** The fundamental shift in Stage 4 is moving the "seat of judgment" from external sources to an internal one. Individuals at this stage develop their own personal ideology or framework of values and beliefs. They can now evaluate and filter external expectations and opinions through their own internal system, rather than being defined by them. They are the "author" of their own story and identity.
    
- **Taking Relationships as "Object":** In Kegan's terminology, a Stage 4 individual is no longer "subject" to their relationships as they were in Stage 3. Instead, they can take their relationships and social roles as "object." This means they can step back, reflect on them, manage them, and hold them as part of their life without being completely fused with them. Their identity exists apart from their role as a partner, employee, or member of a community.
    
- **Defining and Setting Boundaries:** Because they have their own internal framework, people in Stage 4 can effectively navigate the conflicting expectations of others. Where a Stage 3 person would feel torn and conflicted, a Stage 4 person can prioritise, make decisions, and set boundaries based on their own values and sense of self.
    
- **Ownership of Internal State:** Individuals at this stage take ownership of their own internal emotional state. They understand that they are the source of their own feelings and are less likely to feel that others are "making" them feel a certain way. They can manage their own moods and emotions in service of their long-term goals.
    

Moving from Stage 3 to Stage 4 is a demanding process of differentiating oneself from the social environment and constructing a reliable internal compass to guide one's life.
