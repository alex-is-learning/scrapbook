### Skill 1: Find X
- [[The first half of the elenchus]]
- *There's a whole chapter dedicated to this!* 
	- *Chapter 17: Finding Principles*
- Socrates would be very good at drawing out the underlying thing (e.g., in the dialogue *Laches*, taking the conversation re: whether the sons should wear armour, into a discussion about courage)
### Skill 2: Find Y
- [[The second half of the elenchus]]
- *There's a whole chapter dedicated to this!* 
	- *Chapter 18: Testing Principles
- Now you need to find a Y that the other person (or yourself) will also agree with
