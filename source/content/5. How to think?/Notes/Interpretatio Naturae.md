	- **Interpretatio Naturae (Interpretation of Nature):** This is the methodical and gradual process Bacon advocated for. It involves deriving axioms from sense experience and particular facts in a slow, upward climb to reach the most general conclusions last. This systematic approach is designed to restrain the mind's tendency to jump to conclusions and to build knowledge on a solid foundation of empirical evidence.
