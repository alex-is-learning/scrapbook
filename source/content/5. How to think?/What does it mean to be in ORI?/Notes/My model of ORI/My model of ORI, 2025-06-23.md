- [["What does it mean to be in ORI?" (Open Question)]]
- Below are from conversations with Defender
# Diagrams

# Current open questions:
## “In the process, you’ll lift up others” - how? 
- Fanciful thinking?
- I doubt anyone will read my stuff, my notebook
- I doubt I’ll read through the ORI discord → doubt that there’ll be anything relevant, and don’t have time to dredge through? Discords are very noisy and aversive?
- I guess, maybe a few months from now, I’ll have discovered some novel things, or maybe made guides on how to do non-novel things but in a very tractable way (e.g. a guide to how to help a family member lose weight)
## Novel contributions aren’t terminal goals, right? They’re instrumental? 
- It could be that, in trying to answer my most pressing questions (like e.g. “how do I help my mum lose weight”, I don’t uncover anything novel
- Maybe this is wrong, but I assume most quotidian questions won’t involve novel solutions? Like, these things are solved problems, the main problems in your life?
