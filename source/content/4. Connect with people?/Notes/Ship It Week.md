29 August – 7 September 2025 | Casa Tilo

Ship-It-Week is a 10-day co-living and co-working retreat designed to help you bring your idea to life — with focus, inspiration, and a crew of kindred spirits by your side.

Hosted at the beautiful Casa Tilo Villa located in the stunning Mont Negre national park, this retreat is about finding your flow — whether you want to build an app, revamp your website, write that article, film your next video, launch a workshop, or simply carve out space to work on something that matters to you.

We’ll share meals, stories, ideas and feedback. We’ll walk, talk, work, rest, and create. We’ll support each other to stay on course, navigate the rough patches, and celebrate the wins. The internet is fast, the food is nourishing, the vibes are relaxed — and yes, there will be a party.

This is not a bootcamp or a grind. It’s a space of light structure, mutual support, and deep focus — a chance to live and work alongside others who are also building, refining, or launching something they care about.

Ship-It-Week is a collaboration between _The Garden_ and _Casa Tilo_ and you’ll be hosted by [Jocelyn & Nicki Endres](https://thegarden.love/who-we-are/), and the lovely Casa Tilo team.

Let’s grow and ship together!
