- Yesterday was the first full day
- I'm sat outside by the pool, Brent is meditating and giggling to my left
- How do I feel?
## It's so great
- The actual *Shipping* hasn't begun yet, but I tweeted on day 1 something like "oh this is already amazing", and Rich replied asking why, which I haven't replied to yet
