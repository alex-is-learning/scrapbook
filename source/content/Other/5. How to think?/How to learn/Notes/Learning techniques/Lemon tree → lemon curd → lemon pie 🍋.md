- My friend Simmo shared a photo of him holding a lemon with the caption "fallen lemons", and another friend said "that'd be a good substack name", and then I said:
	- *"There‚Äôs something kinda nice there, about writing as like attempting to grow a healthy lemon tree, where for a while you can only grow these like shitty shrivelled fruits, it takes a good long while before the fruits are very plump and juicy"*
	- *"And the raw lemon might be pretty sour so you have to mix in a bunch of sugar (e.g. using storytelling to make the key ideas more palatable/likely to be consumed)"*
	- *"You pluck a healthy lemon and are like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really pleased with this lemon how it is, but I know I‚Äôm gonna need to sweeten it into a curd or something to make **other** people want it‚Äù*
	- *"My ==public notebook as a load of raw lemons== vs substack as the place to make the curd, and maybe one day I‚Äôll make a lemon meringue pie ü•ß"*
		- Maybe a book or more youtube videos or something?
