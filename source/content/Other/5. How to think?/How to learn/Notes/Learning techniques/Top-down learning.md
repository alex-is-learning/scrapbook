- Vs [[Bottom-up learning]]

> *Note - [this twitter thread](https://x.com/ejames_c/status/1895416279722594311)] is where I first heard the terms bottom-up vs top-down learning*

- Top-down learning is what Defender of Basic writes about [here](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/geoffrey-hinton-on-developing-your)
- Pretty much "make predictions, grapple with reality, make a model, face the fact that your model is terrible, get your ego involved, cash out the predictions and see what you got wrong"
- Super powerful because the learnings are incredibly salient - "omg I can't believe I thought x, how embarrassing, now I know y" â†’ leads to very durable updates
- Also just super fun

- Turns out this is similar to reading to _engage_ (as opposed to reading to _understand_)
