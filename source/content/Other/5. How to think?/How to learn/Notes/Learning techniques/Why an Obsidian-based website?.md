- [[How to make a website like this]]
- 2025-08-01
- I shared this guide with a friend and he was like "why not Wix or Wordpress? They have free tiers"
- The point, for me, is that with this setup, you just use Obsidian as normal, and hit "publish" periodically
	- So, if you're already a fan of Obsidian, it's the environment you already like, but as a website
- At the time of writing (2025-08-01), this "website" has 144 different pages - I imagine this'd be a pain in Wordpress etc
- And I can interconnect pages effortlessly, which is nice
