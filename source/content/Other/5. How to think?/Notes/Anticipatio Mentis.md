- Francis Bacon
- Gemini:
	- **Anticipatio Mentis (Anticipation of the Mind):** This is a "rash and premature" method where the mind leaps from a few sensory observations and particular instances to the most general axioms or principles. From these hastily formed generalisations, one then deduces intermediate axioms to prove that the initial generalisation was correct. Bacon saw this as the common, but incorrect, logical method of his time, believing it led to dogma and error because it was based on insufficient evidence and inherent biases of the mind.
