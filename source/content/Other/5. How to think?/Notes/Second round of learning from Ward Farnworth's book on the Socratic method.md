# What should I do?
## Lazy but slow way → make flashcards from every chapter, in order
- The benefit of this approach is that you don't have to use your brain much, lol
- But it's not a very targeted/efficient/prioritised way to learn, e.g. identifying the top 3 chapters to get a deeper understanding of first, vs "I guess I'll make flashcards from all 200 pages"
## Identify specific chapters
Here are the chapters:
1. The Socratic Problem
2. Method vs. Doctrine
3. Elements of the Method
4. The Socratic Function
5. Question and Answer
6. The Elenchus
7. Consistency
8. Systole and Diastole
9. Analogies
10. Socratic Rules for Dialogue
11. Ignorance
12. Aporia
13. Socratic Goods
14. Socratic Ethics
15. Socrates and the Stoics
16. Socrates and the Skeptics
17. Finding Principles
18. Testing Principles
19. EPILOGUE: Socratic Rules of Engagement
## Here's my reorganised version
### 1. Meta → the "why", the profundity
1. The Socratic Problem (ch.1)

5. Finding Principles (ch.17)
6. Testing Principles (ch.18)
## Ok, so...
- I think the "why"/the profundity is definitely grokked enough. I'm very on board, this is very alive for me currently. I'm currently in a mode where the danger of my own double-ignorance has been made very apparent/salient to me
