- Placeholder page â†’ I've been wondering like... "is my ability to think really my bottleneck?" - it almost certainly isn't... or maybe it is... thinking, thinking...
- What it might be is something like "==ok, I have the basic, 80/20 mechanics of thinking down== â†’ I can investigate my epistemics, I can find cruxes etc"
	- E.g., [[Should I meditate regularly?]] & [[Questioning Effective Altruism]] both show me thinking
- But there's still stuff to do, ==non-mechanics stuff==, e.g.
	- Epistemics â†’ I haven't e.g. used [[The elenchus]] to discover [[Popperian truth]]s to use as ==north stars==
	- Morality â†’ I know nothing about morality and free will. I imagine learning about this could be useful. (I had an intro call with a philosophy tutor the other day who shared a really dense thing with me that seems like it could be useful)
	- ðŸ‘‡ planning on making my way through this
