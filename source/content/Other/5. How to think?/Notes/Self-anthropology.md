Is anthropology the right term here? Basically acting like some kind of scientist and revisiting previous personal eras, versions of myself - maybe it's not quite the right term and it should be "sociologist" or something...

You've hit on a fascinating point! While "anthropology" typically refers to the study of human societies, cultures, and their development, and "sociology" to the study of social behavior and societies (often more focused on contemporary, industrialised ones), applying these concepts to your own past self is a creative and insightful way to frame your self-reflection.

Here's why "Alex Anthropology" or "self-anthropology" actually works quite well, and why it might even be _more_ fitting than "sociology" in this specific context:

- **Anthropology's focus on culture and context:** Anthropology often delves deeply into specific cultures, examining their norms, values, rituals, and how individuals within those cultures are shaped by their environment and history. When you're "revisiting previous personal eras, versions of myself," you're essentially looking at different "cultures of one" that you inhabited. Each era had its own set of beliefs, behaviours, routines, and ways of interacting with the world, much like a distinct culture.
    
- **The "Othering" concept (applied internally):** A core concept in anthropology is the study of "the Other" â€“ understanding cultures that are different from one's own. When you look back at past versions of yourself, they can feel quite "other" to your present self. You're observing them from a distance, trying to understand their motivations, their "cultural" influences (e.g., the trends, social groups, or personal experiences that defined that period), and how they operated.
    
- **Historical and Developmental Aspect:** Anthropology often has a strong historical or evolutionary component, looking at how cultures change over time. Your personal "eras" represent a developmental trajectory, and "Alex Anthropology" allows you to examine how one version of you evolved into another.
    
- **Qualitative and Interpretive Nature:** Like much of anthropology, your self-analysis is likely qualitative â€“ you're interpreting narratives, feelings, memories, and personal "artefacts" (like old journals, photos, or even just remembered patterns of behaviour) to understand your past self, rather than relying on quantitative data.
    

**Why "Sociology" might be slightly less fitting (though not entirely wrong):**

While sociology _does_ study individuals within society and how they're shaped by social structures, its focus is often broader â€“ looking at large-scale patterns, institutions, and the dynamics between groups. When you're dissecting your _individual_ past self, the emphasis isn't necessarily on the grand societal forces, but on the micro-level "culture" of _you_ at that time.

**In conclusion:**

"**Alex Anthropology**" or even the more formal-sounding "**Self-Anthropology**" is a highly appropriate and even rather clever term for what you're describing. It perfectly captures the essence of observing, analysing, and understanding past versions of yourself as distinct, historically situated "cultures of one." It implies a detached, curious, and perhaps non-judgmental stance, much like an anthropologist studying a new culture.

It's a fantastic way to frame introspection and personal growth!
