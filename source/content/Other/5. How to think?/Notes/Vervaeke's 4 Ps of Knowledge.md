Of course. Here is a summary of John Vervaeke's "4 P's of Knowing," a central framework from his series _Awakening from the Meaning Crisis_.

Vervaeke proposes this model to counter the modern tendency to reduce all knowledge to a single type: facts. He argues that knowing is a multi-layered, embodied process. The 4 P's are four distinct but deeply interconnected kinds of knowing.

### The Four Kinds of Knowing

The four types are **Propositional**, **Procedural**, **Perspectival**, and **Participatory**. They are best understood as a nested hierarchy, with each level grounding the one above it.

#### 1. Propositional Knowing: _Knowing That_

This is the most commonly understood form of knowledge. It consists of facts, theories, and statements that can be held as beliefs and declared to be true or false.

- **Nature:** Abstract, explicit, and factual. It is knowledge that you can write down or state in a sentence.
    
- **Examples:**
    - Knowing _that_ London is the capital of the United Kingdom.
    - Knowing _that_ E=mc2.
    - Knowing _that_ the Earth is the third planet from the Sun.
- **Limitation:** On its own, propositional knowledge can be inert. You can know all the facts _about_ how to swim without actually knowing _how_ to swim.
#### 2. Procedural Knowing: _Knowing How_
This is knowledge as a skill or ability. It is the capacity to perform a sequence of actions fluently to achieve a goal.

- **Nature:** Embodied, implicit, and performance-based. It is a skill you demonstrate through action.
- **Examples:**
    - Knowing _how_ to ride a bicycle.
    - Knowing _how_ to play a musical instrument.
    - Knowing _how_ to speak a language.
- **Relationship:** Procedural knowing gives context and utility to propositional knowing. The procedures of scientific experimentation, for example, are what allow us to generate reliable propositions (facts).
#### 3. Perspectival Knowing: _Knowing What It's Like_

This is the knowledge of what it is like to be a particular knower in a particular state or situation. It is about your point of view, your field of awareness, and what is relevant or salient to you.

- **Nature:** Situational, subjective, and contextual. It shapes what you notice and care about. Vervaeke calls this your "salience landscape".
- **Examples:**
    - Knowing _what it's like_ to be a parent, which makes certain facts and skills immediately relevant that were not before.
    - Knowing _what it's like_ to feel grief or joy.
    - An expert chess player's perspective, where they see the board in terms of threats and opportunities invisible to a novice.
- **Relationship:** Your perspective organises your skills (procedural) and prioritises which facts (propositional) matter to you.
#### 4. Participatory Knowing: _Knowing by Being_

This is the most fundamental form of knowing. It is about the shared identity and reality between the knower and the known. You are transformed by the act of knowing, conforming yourself to a particular reality.

- **Nature:** Foundational, identity-shaping, and transformational. It involves deep identification and a mutual shaping process.
- **Examples:**
    - Knowing someone by being in a loving relationship with them. You and the other person are co-creating a shared reality, and your identity is partially constituted by that relationship.
    - Being a citizen of a country. Your identity is shaped by participating in its culture, language, and social structures.
    - A master craftsperson's relationship with their material. They don't just act _on_ the wood; they feel what the wood "wants" to become. There is a deep structural and functional coupling between them and their craft.
- **Relationship:** This is the ground of all the other forms of knowing. Your identity (participatory) determines your point of view (perspectival), which organises your skills (procedural), which allows you to test and use facts (propositional).
### The Interrelationship and Why It Matters

Vervaeke argues that the 4 P's are not separate options but a deeply integrated system. The model flows from the bottom up:

**Participatory → Perspectival → Procedural → Propositional**

Our modern culture has over-emphasised propositional knowing, treating it as the only "real" knowledge. This creates a disconnect from the embodied, lived, and transformational aspects of knowing, which Vervaeke argues is a major contributor to the "meaning crisis".

By understanding knowledge through all 4 P's, we get a much richer picture. **Wisdom**, in this framework, is not just possessing many facts, but the dynamic integration of all four kinds of knowing to skilfully and appropriately realise relevance and live a flourishing life.

### Summary Table

| The 'P'           | Type of Knowing          | Description                                             | Example                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Propositional** | Knowing _That_           | Abstract facts, beliefs, and statements.                | "Paris is the capital of France." |
| **Procedural**    | Knowing _How_            | Embodied skills and abilities.                          | Riding a bicycle.                 |
| **Perspectival**  | Knowing _What It's Like_ | The knower's point of view and salience landscape.      | An expert's view of a situation.  |
| **Participatory** | Knowing _by Being_       | Identity-level knowing through co-shaping with reality. | Being in a loving relationship.   |
