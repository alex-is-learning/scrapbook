- [[Life Reviews]]
- At the time of writing, it's Monday, 2025-07-21
- Below are my priorities for the week/where I'm currently at with things:
# Upcoming week
## 1. Improve Thinking
1. Got calls with philosophy/ethics/"how to think" tutors
2. Will keep going re: e..g NVC. Following intuition & adding to scrapbook
3. *(This feels less like something I plan and more like something where I follow the aliveness)*
## 2. Money
- Different opportunities currently on the table:
	1. **Outcapped** → had a call w/ Rob on Thur, emailed him my concerns on Fri, haven’t heard from him yet
	2. **Notify Health** → do I want to try for it? 
		1. Founder’s Associate, cool role, but… dreadful pay? Maybe only full time?
	3. **High Impact Professionals** → special database for finalists of highly competitive hiring rounds
	4. Personal invitation to apply for Operations role at **Probably Good**
- Find other things! Look on 80,000 Hours etc, EAG London Slack
## 3. Soul/family
1. First session with a systemic/family therapist, today! (Just me for now)
2. Continue learning NVC
## 4. Friends
- Microsolidarity crew call 
## 5. Health
- Continue my health stack - swimming, 10000+ steps, chronometer
