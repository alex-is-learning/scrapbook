- *(Deprecated on 2025-07-17)*:
- As of 2025-06-12, I am a member of the [Open Research Institute](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/how-do-we-bootstrap-the-open-research?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2)!
	- https://openresearchinstitute.org/ & Github https://github.com/Open-Research-Institute
- This website is me learning how to think via [[Top-down learning]], vs the [[Bottom-up learning]] that I've almost entirely used *up** until this point
- This is inspired by [this post by Defender of Basic](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/geoffrey-hinton-on-developing-your). 
- Kickoff post with a quick sketch of why I'm doing this - [here](https://www.alexislearning.me/learning-how-to-think/)
- Here is Defender of Basic's [similar notebook](https://defenderofbasic.github.io/notebook/)
# Why deprecated? 
- I initially was excited to improve my world model via making predictions, and then cashing them out (that is, top-down learning)
- E.g., the Israel-Iran series
	- [[Israel & Iran (session 1)]]
	- [[Israel & Iran (session 2)]]
	- [[Israel & Iran (session 3)]]
	- [[Israel & Iran (session 4)]]
- But then, part of the onboarding for the Open Research Institute (thanks for @DefenderofBasic for being a mentor) involved thinking about what you actually care about
- This led to refocusing on my most salient "open questions", e.g.:
	- [["How can I improve my ability to think?" (Parent Page)]]
	- [["How can I change how to orient to my family?" (Open Question)]]
- Improving my world model would be great, I'd love to be really well educated and informed. But it doesn't feel like the most pressing thing!
