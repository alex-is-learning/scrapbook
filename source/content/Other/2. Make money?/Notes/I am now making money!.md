## Outcapped
- Wahoo! Day 2 of doing contractor work for Outcapped
- Feels so great to be like "ahh, I've made money today"

## Backup plans
- The "how do I make money?" open question isn't quite closed yet, because this is an early stage startup so it doesn't feel particularly secure. I'd like to have a plan B, perhaps a second contractor role
- I have a few things I've applied for and am waiting to hear back from. And I finally heard back from Philip Tetlock's "Forecasting Research Institute", and have a 5-10 hour paid work trial for a part time role for them to do
