- **Family**? → just do Fetters work & daily face deconstruction meditation
- **Money**? → just lock in to Outcapped and be as useful as possible
- **Creating/Platform-Building**? → just do 1 youtube vid a week, 1 substack a week, a written vignette a day
- **Connecting with more people**? → plan a group house with Simmo and visit intentional community(s) in the meantime
- **Learning to think**? → this isn't your bottleneck, time to flip the "80% meta, 20% object-level" for a bit! No more thinking required

- Vs my failure mode of "too much meta, too much thinking and planning and refining and iterating"
- I think locking in clear goals, "this is what I'm working on, these *deliverables*, not thinking about things but doing things", feels really good right now
