- I don't know much about it
- I want to quickly investigate it for a family member
## Questions
1. What is the generic name?
2. How does it work
3. What are the side effects
4. How "fast" does it work? 
5. Cost/month? Cost per lb lost?
6. Side effects?
7. Uptake? I.e., trend, and how it is perceived
## Predictions
1. Ozempic is a GLP-1 agonist → 60%
	1. ✅
2. Ozempic is a GLP-1 antagonist → 40%
	1. ❌
3. GLP-1 is... a receptor that... encourages fat metabolism? 40%
	1. ❌ No, it's all about appetite suppression!

Generic name → semaglutide

(This is a short one, I ended up reading a deep research report and folding what I needed into a Google Slide deck. Don't need to go deep here!)
