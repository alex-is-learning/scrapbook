## Basics
```
Acronym for the four components of NVC  
{{c1::OFNR}}
|
First of the 4 components of NVC
{{c1::Observations}}
|
Second of the 4 components of NVC
{{c1::Feelings}}
|
Third of the 4 components of NVC
{{c1::Needs}}
|
Fourth of the 4 components of NVC
{{c1::Requests}}
```
## Observations
```
According to NVC principles, an observation should be 
{{c1::a statement of fact, free from what four elements}}
|
Acronym for the 4 elements that an NVC observation should be free from:
{{c1::JEDI}}
|
The 4 elements that an NVC observation should be free from
{{c1::Judgement}}
{{c1::Evaluation}}
{{c2::Diagnosis}}
{{c2::Interpretation}}
|
The 4 elements that an NVC observation should be free from
{{c1::Judgement}}
{{c1::Evaluation}}
{{c1::Diagnosis}}
{{c1::Interpretation}}
|
The primary goal of starting with a clean observation in NVC is 
{{c1::to establish a shared reality with the other person}}
|
In NVC,
Starting with a neutral, factual observation helps to lower the chance of 
{{c1::triggering defensiveness}}
|
What is the most difficult aspect of mastering the observation stage in NVC
{{c1::Separating what we observe from how we interpret it}}
|
In the context of NVC, any statement containing 
judgement, analysis, criticism, or interpretation is known as an
{{c1::Evaluation}}
|
NVC
The use of words like 'good', 'bad', 'lazy', or 'rude' are indicators of an
{{c1::Evaluation}}
|
NVC
Words that generalise, such as 
'always', 'never', 'ever', and 'constantly', 
are almost always a sign of: 
{{c1::An evaluation}}
|
A helpful mental model for 
{{c2::formulating a clean NVC observation}}
is to act as if 
{{c1::You are a video camera}}
|
Rather than making generalisations, a clean observation should use what kind of information
{{c1::Specific, concrete data (e.g., times, dates, amounts, quotes)}}
|
When formulating an observation, one should focus on 
{{c1::describing a person's action}}, 
not 
{{c1::what you believe to be their character}}
|
How can you share an interpretation while still adhering to NVC principles
{{c1::By owning it as your personal story, e.g., "The story I told myself was..."}}
|
In the NVC framework, starting with a clean observation is considered 
{{c1::an act of respect}}
|
NVC
Rephrase the evaluation "You never listen to me" into a specific, factual observation
{{c1::"When I was speaking just now, I noticed you were scrolling through your phone"}}
|
NVC
Rephrase the evaluation "Your work has been sloppy recently" into a specific, factual observation
{{c1::"I read through the report you submitted and I found three factual errors and several spelling mistakes"}}
|
NVC
Rephrase the evaluation "He is a procrastinator" into a behaviour-based observation
{{c1::"He said he would complete the task by Tuesday. It's now Thursday and I have not received it"}}
|
After establishing a shared reality with an observation, 
the other person is more open to hearing 
the subsequent steps in the NVC model, 
which are
{{c1::Feelings, Needs, and Request}}
|
Without the solid foundation of a shared observation, 
a conversation can quickly devolve into an argument about 
{{c1::"What really happened"}}
```
## Feelings
```
In the NVC model, 
What is the specific function of the 'Feelings' step
{{c1::It acts as the crucial bridge 
between an external event (Observation) 
and our internal motivation (Need)}}
|
According to NVC, how is a 'feeling' defined
{{c1::As a pure emotional or physical sensation 
that arises within us}}
|
In NVC, what is a feeling explicitly *not*
{{c1::An assessment or evaluation of the world or other people}}
|
From a cognitive science perspective, 
why does expressing genuine feelings 
foster connection more effectively 
than making accusations
{{c1::Genuine feeling statements can engage the listener's empathy circuits, 
while accusations are more likely to trigger a defensive threat response}}
|
What is the primary personal goal of the 'Feelings' step in NVC
{{c1::To take responsibility for one's own emotional state}}
|
In the NVC model, what do our feelings directly signal
{{c1::Whether our universal human needs 
are currently being met 
or are not being met}}
|
What term does NVC use for 
{{c2::a thought or judgment that is disguised as a feeling, }}
such as "I feel abandoned"
{{c1::A 'faux feeling'}}
|
What is the main problem with using a 'faux feeling' in a conversation
{{c1::It implies that someone else is responsible for our feeling, 
which can trigger defensiveness and block connection}}
|
What are the two common linguistic patterns 
that often signal a 'faux feeling' is being expressed
{{c1::"I feel..." followed by a past participle (e.g., judged, ignored) }}
or 
{{c2::"I feel..." followed by the words "that" or "like"}}
|
What are the two common linguistic patterns 
that often signal a 'faux feeling' is being expressed
{{c1::"I feel..." followed by a past participle (e.g., judged, ignored) }}
or 
{{c1::"I feel..." followed by the words "that" or "like"}}
|
How would you translate the faux feeling 
"I feel attacked" 
into a statement of genuine NVC feelings
{{c1::I feel scared, hurt, or defensive}}
|
How would you translate the faux feeling 
"I feel misunderstood" 
into a statement of genuine NVC feelings
{{c1::I feel frustrated, annoyed, or discouraged}}
|
How would you translate the faux feeling 
"I feel manipulated"
into a statement of genuine NVC feelings
{{c1::I feel angry, powerless, or confused}}
|
The psychological principle of '{{c2::affect labelling}}' 
supports which key practice in NVC
{{c1::Building a rich feelings vocabulary}}, 
as 
{{c1::putting specific labels on emotions can help to regulate them}}
|
NVC organises its vocabulary of feelings 
into two broad categories based on what condition
{{c1::Whether our universal needs 
are being met 
or are not being met}}
|
What is the simple two-part formula 
for connecting an Observation to a Feeling in NVC
"{{c1::When I see/hear [Observation], I feel [Feeling]}}"
|
Why is a well-formed NVC statement of 
observation and feeling 
so difficult for another person to argue with
{{c1::Because it is a factual report 
of an external event 
and a personal internal reaction}}
|
What are the four disciplined practices 
that define the 'Feelings' component of NVC
{{c1::
1. Looking inward to identify pure emotions
2. Taking ownership
3. Distinguishing feelings from thoughts 
4. Expressing them with vulnerability}}
|
NVC
Mastering the 'Feelings' step 
enables what fundamental shift in communication?
{{c1::It transforms a confrontational statement 
about the other person 
("what you did") 
into a connecting statement about oneself 
("how I am")}}
