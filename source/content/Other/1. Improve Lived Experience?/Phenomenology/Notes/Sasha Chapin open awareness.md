- From "[What I wish someone had told me about starting a meditation practice](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/what-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about)"

- Here is a better set of beginner meditation instructions: 
- “Settle in a ==posture== that, for you, provides a good compromise between comfort and alertness. 
- Open yourself to the ==detail== of your experience. 
- Allow yourself to be interested in, and receptive to, the rich, ==particular texture== of what’s happening—look beyond the concept of experience into what’s actually going on with your mind, and senses, and emotions. 
- ==Don’t argue with what’s there==. 
- If you wish, bring your attention to a meditation ==object==, like a mantra, or the flow of your breath, and notice how this tends to make your experience more collected and calmer. 
- Orient towards whatever brings relief, wakeful relaxation, and ==pleasantness==. 
- Do this for anywhere between thirty seconds and ninety minutes.”
