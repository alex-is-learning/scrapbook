- [[Airpods are kind of insidious]]

- *Why make a cup of tea in silence when there are comedy podcasts to listen to?*
- I am certain that I will have listened to thousands of hours of comedy podcasts in the past 5 years. In fact, I think COVID was the time it really took off for me
- Ok, let's do a quick podcast audit retrospective
## 3a. My first podcasts → Hello Internet and If I Were You
- Ahhh, a life era I totally forgot about! 
- I worked at the corner shop in my little english village. I'd stock the shelves, man the register, eat multiple chocolate bars per shift in the storage room (hehe). Serve the private school kids, etc
- Pre-airpods - I'd sometimes listen to podcasts via my ipod. Bit of a sense of "I probably shouldn't be listening to podcasts at a service job", but it was chill. I actually really enjoyed the job, something very nice about existing in this tiny world, checking up on the shelves, serving the locals, etc 
### Hello Internet

- This debuted around the time I got my first ever part-time job. I was I guess 14-15, so... 
- (I was a day 1 fan! Listened all the way through)
- Two friends, CGP Grey and Brady Haran, talk about... stuff. A large part of the "engine" of the show is their different worldviews → Grey as the hyper left-brain nerdy productivity guy, Brady as the novelty and fun loving charming australian. Really lovely. Sadly it seemed to end with a falling out - they just stopped posting, claimed it was a hiatus, but never really addressed anything - this was ~5 years ago. A real bummer for the fans who were suddenly left high and dry without a goodbye episode or anything, felt very unceremonious

- (A fan made a series of [animated shorts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtaMg2m5Tc8) from the episodes)
- There were 136 weekly episodes, actually not a podcast that I ever felt a need to relisten to, so let's just pretend each episode was an hour long and call it 136 hours
### If I Were You
- Another one that I was a day 1 fan for. They were still making Jake and Amir when it came out. I remember listening at the corner shop and being surprised to learn that Amir was the nerdy and kind of quiet one and Jake was a kind of insecure womaniser
- ![[Airpods are kind of insideous-1754833801578.webp]]
- Listened for the first ~250 episodes - I remember being at uni and feeling that it had gotten repetitive/samey and giving up on it
- Much more relistenable than Hello Internet b/c comedy innit. Lets guess 300 hours
## 3b. COVID
- I think after If I Were You I got much more into music → 1st-3rd year of music was a really music-heavy time for me, discovered rap, Radiohead, Anthony Fantano, it was really really great. Way less podcasts, too much great music to enjoy
### My Dad Wrote a Porno
- This was COVID era find
- ![[Airpods are kind of insideous-1754833955412.webp]]
- Sooooooo fucking funny dude. I think I've listened to it like 4 times all the way through
