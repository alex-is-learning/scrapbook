`What's the buddhist word for breath meditation, it's like... anapana something`

You've remembered correctly! The Buddhist term for breath meditation is **Ānāpānasati**.

This Pāli word can be broken down to understand its meaning:

- **Ānāpāna** refers to the inhalation and exhalation of breath.
- **Sati** means mindfulness.

Therefore, **Ānāpānasati** literally translates to "mindfulness of breathing." It is a fundamental and widely practised form of meditation in various Buddhist traditions.

The practice involves focusing one's attention on the natural sensation of the breath as it enters and leaves the body. This is not about controlling the breath, but rather observing it as it is. By anchoring the mind to the breath, practitioners can develop concentration, calmness, and a deeper awareness of the present moment.

The teachings on Ānāpānasati are detailed in the _Ānāpānasati Sutta_, a discourse attributed to the Buddha, which outlines sixteen steps to guide the meditation practice. ==It is considered a cornerstone of mindfulness practice and a path to cultivating insight and wisdom.==
