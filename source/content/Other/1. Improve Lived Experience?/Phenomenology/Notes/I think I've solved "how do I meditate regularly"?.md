- My struggle from [[2025-07-22 meditation open questions]] was "how do I sit for more than 20 minutes? I get so restless"
- So, I had the idea to vibe-code a thing that takes a photo of me every 5 mins with a timestamp, that I could send to friends
- So I message them like "I'm gonna meditate for 1 hour and if I fail I'll pay you both £10", and then I send them the proof gif, e.g.
# Sit 1
- ![[sit 001 output_timelapse-2025-07-27-1303.gif]]
# Sit 2
- ![[sit 002 output_timelapse_20250728-195044.gif]]
# Sit 3
- ![[sit 003 output_timelapse_20250729-122450.gif]]
# So... this solves it?
- This seems to solve problem 1, which is like "I know 1 hour sits are kind of the ideal length, and I can do them when on a retreat or in a cohort, but I can't do them solo"
- Now I can! 
- Now it's just a case of doing them daily. Because I wrote [[Should I meditate regularly?]], I still feel consensus to meditate → I have internal alignment re: the profundity. So, this currently feels like a solved thing → I want to do it daily, I have a good accountability mechanism, boom
- I also have [[Meditation log]] to show that I've meditated daily
