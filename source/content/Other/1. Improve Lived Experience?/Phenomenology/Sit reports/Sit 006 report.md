- [[Meditation log]]
- **Date & Time:** 2025-08-01 12:00
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
- **Summary of the Sit:** 
    - Super distracted
    - Starting to worry that I'm not improving
    - However, I have found that counting is helping somewhat
    - I also tried a thing of "when I remember to return to the breath, also relax", which hopefully will create a bit of a more potent reward mechanism
    - I might also try doing 10-30 mins right before bed to get some more reps in
- **Key Takeaway / Question:** 
    - I think I should read a bit of "The Mind Illuminated" to see if there are any tips for my current stage (which is probably stage 1 or 2, from that book's framework?)
