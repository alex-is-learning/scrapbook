# Pre-Meditation Preparation
- **Date & Time:** 2025-08-03  22:00
- **Planned Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
### 1. My Motivations
- _(Why am I choosing to practise right now? What are my deeper, long-term goals?)_
	- I want to get over the "beginner mind", "99.9% distracted" default state, so that I can unlock further meditation benefits (e.g. daily metta)
### 2. My Goal for This Session
- _(What is the specific, achievable aim for this sit? What stage am I working on?)_
	- I'm on stage 2 of TMI
		- "Interrupted Attention and Overcoming Mind-Wandering"
	- I want to continue counting my breath (scaffolding), relaxing and celebrating the "aha" moment (sati)
### 3. Anticipating Hindrances
- _(What challenges might arise? (e.g., sleepiness, noise, restlessness, specific thoughts). How will I meet them with patience?)_
	- I am guaranteed to get lost in thought
### 4. Commitment to Posture
- _(Is my posture stable, aligned, and relaxed? I commit to maintaining stillness as best I can.)_
	- Yep, got my meditation cushion setup
### 5. Reviewing the Master Plan
- _(I am currently practising at "The Mind Illuminated" Stage ___. The main skill to develop is...)_
	- See point 2
### 6. Generating Diligence & Enthusiasm
- _(I am grateful for this opportunity to practise. I will engage wholeheartedly for the entire session.)_
	- It's true! I'm grateful to be on this path. I'm also *really* grateful that vibe-coding is a thing → I love my "take a photo of me every 5 mins" python script
# Post-Meditation Reflection
- **Actual Duration:** 60 mins
### 1. General Impression
- _(Without judgement, what was the overall flavour of this sit? (e.g., calm, restless, sleepy, focused, agitated, clear, dull))_
	- Very lost in thought
	- Never got up to 10 mindful breaths
	- Had 15+ "remembering" moments (sati)
