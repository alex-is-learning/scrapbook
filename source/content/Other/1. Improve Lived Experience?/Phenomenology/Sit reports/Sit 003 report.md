- [[Meditation log]]
- **Date & Time:** 2025-07-29 11:30
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
- **Summary of the Sit:** 
    - Distracted as hell
    - Near the end, experimented with a new thing of "when I remember to come back to the breath, smile as I do it" → figure it might add a bit more of a reward function, make the nostrils more salient, more obvious that nostrils are the aim right now, not daydreaming/ideating
    - Had a bunch of kinda good ideas, lol
	- Timelapse thing continues to make sitting for an entire hour totally effortless. No desire at any point to cut it short. Messaged my friends "1 hour long sit, black mirror gif or £10 fine!"
- **Key Takeaway / Question:** 
    - Just keep going!!
