- [[Meditation log]]
- *Voice note to a friend who, in response to me saying this is my fifth day in a row, said: "nice one! Have you noticed any benefits?"*
	- ![[signal-2025-07-31-133412.mp3]]
- **Date & Time:** 2025-07-31
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Technique:** [[Ānāpānasati (Anapanasati)]]
- **Summary of the Sit:** 
    - Some progress! 
    - For what I'm pretty sure is the first time, I had a few instances of forgetting my breath for 1-2 seconds and then immediately remembering ("sati") again
    - Still many 1-5 minute stretches of being totally lost in thought. Still like 99% distracted I'd say 
    - I started experimenting with counting my breaths for a crutch too
- **Key Takeaway / Question:** 
    - Try a full sit where I count my breaths (for a crutch)
    - Stretch before sitting! I've got crazy DOMS today
