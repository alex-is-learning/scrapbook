- From [[What help do I want from Sasha Chapin re writing etc?]]
- I'm not necessarily endorsing much of what ChatGPT has written here, but I wanted to experiment with it as I'm not ready for Sasha's >$300/hr coaching yet
- I think generative AI is pretty great for strategy stuff and really dreadful for creative stuff, like when it said "write a post with this title!" it was awful, but the tactics-type stuff is good and useful
- The below are in reverse-chronological order, that is, heading 1 is the most recent reply

# 1 - Ultra-Concise Summary
- Except it's not concise at all because it turns out GPT5 is WORDY AS FUCK DUDE

> so it seems like an  ultra-concise, "what to do next" thing is like "start writing a new substack, channeling what's alive, see where it takes me, and then do a 2nd pass, a 3rd pass, refining it, cutting out the throat-clearing, then share with some friends, then make a video to go along with it"?

> note the attached post by Sasha which is why I say that I want to channel what is currently alive (v.s. e.g. starting with a cynical topic in mind like "how to use anger as part of your creative funnel!", which sounds rancid and linkedin-brained to me) (this is the pdf of [Notes Against Note-Taking Systems](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems))

yep—that skeleton is right. let’s lock it into a tiny, repeatable recipe that’s “alive-first” and anti-LinkedIn-brained.
## Do-this-next (ultra-concise)

1. **Channel what’s alive (25–40 min).**
    - Sit, notice the hottest thing in your system, and write it straight—no research, no “positioning.” This aligns with Sasha’s “most heart-stopping writing comes from synthesizing the unarticulated _in the moment_.” 
	- <span class="text-red">"Hottest" is weird phrasing, Chat</span>
    
2. **Pass 2 — find the kernel (10 min).**
    - Highlight the single sacred claim/outcome you actually believe. Paste it to the top in ≤60 words. (This is Sasha’s “write what’s sacred, assume affinity.”) 
3. **Pass 3 — throat-clearing purge (10 min).**
    - Nuke hedges, preambles, and explaining-yourself until the piece **starts hot**. If P1 still reads like setup, delete it. (His exact note: tons of throat-clearing; start at the kernel.) 
4. **Tiny friend read (10 min).**
    - Send to 2 friends with **two questions only**:
	    - “What was the _first line_ that made you lean in?”
	    - “What sentence felt like setup I could cut?”
     - (You already proposed multi-day refinement + friend feedback—keep it lightweight.) 
5. **Ship the Substack.**
    - Title = the promise. One proof, one practice, one vivid moment. (You wanted to publish only the essential—do that.) 
6. **Make the companion video (6–8 min).**
    - Cold-open with the promise, show one concrete bit (demo > tell), single CTA. Keep it fresh, not “advicey.” (Matches your plan to pair posts with videos.)

# 2. Re: Sasha's feedback (throat-clearing)

- Sasha replied and said that my writing is quite moving but has a tonne of throat-clearing preamble in it
- I told this to ChatGPT and asked if this changes much of the plan it suggested for me

Short answer: **yes**—Sasha’s note sharpens the plan. We keep the “new work” sprint, but add one non-negotiable: **==start at the kernel and delete the throat-clearing==**. He literally flagged “a ton of throat-clearing,” said your post’s heart was moving but took forever to arrive, and suggested you “write what’s sacred,” assume readers already get you, then cross out the remaining preamble. Also: let the Enneagram-3 anxiety of not managing perception happen—that’s good. 

## What changes now

- **Kernel-first rule (60 words):** open with the ==sacred claim or outcome== in ≤60 words; no context, no disclaimers. Only after the claim do you give one proof, then the how-to. This directly follows his “sacred + assume affinity + delete preamble” guidance. 
- **Throat-clearing purge (mandatory pass):** before publishing, run the checklist below; if the first paragraph still reads like hedging or scene-setting, ==delete it and re-read==. Repeat until the piece starts at heat. 
- **Assume “already liked” points:** ==stop pre-justifying who you are== or why you’re allowed to say this. Spend those words on the claim, proof, and practice. 

## Next 48 hours (all new work)

### **1) Monday essay (new)**

- **Working title:** 
- **Kernel opener:**
- **Then:** one concrete proof from this week → the 3-step mini-system → 2 pitfalls → invite to try it today.
### **2) Thursday video (new)**

- **Title:**
- **No intro spiel.** Cold-open with the promise 
### **3) Friday micro-piece (new)**

- **Prompt:** 

(To quote the man himself, re: why I'm absolutely repulsed by every ChatGPT suggestion of a topic title/theme):

> "Your natural salience filter is a great determinant of what’s most alive to you. If you begin to rely on any other filter, you will increasingly record what _seems like it should be interesting according to some preexisting criteria_ rather than what organically sticks to your mind. This is a tradeoff. It is often not a worthy tradeoff."

- 👆 from https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems

**Constraint:** 120–180 words. First sentence = the claim. No backstory.

## **Throat-Clearing Purge — fast checklist**

==Delete or rewrite anythin==g that:

- Explains why you’re writing (“I want to talk about…”, “I’ve been thinking a lot about…”)
- Manages perception (“This might be dumb…”, “I know this won’t apply to everyone…”)
- Recaps biography or travelogue before the claim
- Over-hedges (“kind of,” “maybe,” “in some ways”)
- Meta-talks about process (“I’ll probably write more on this later…”)
    
**Tests:**
1. **Paragraph-1 guillotine:** remove it. If the piece improves, keep it gone.
2. **First-line swap:** can your second paragraph be line 1? Make it so.
3. **Stranger scan:** would a stranger know what they get by line 2?
## **Structure to follow on every new piece (for now)**

**Claim (≤60 words) → One proof (scene or stat) → How-to (1–3 steps) → One vivid moment → Invite.** This implements his “sacred first, assume affinity, cut preamble” note exactly. 
## **One tight question to send Sasha (optional)**
- “Here are two kernel openers (≤60 words) for my next essay—**which one is hotter** and what one sentence would you cut?”
- He asked for specific questions, so this matches his bandwidth. 
- If you want, I can draft the full Monday essay now using the kernel-first template.

# 4. ChatGPT on my [[What help do I want from Sasha Chapin re writing etc?]] post + snippets of both our writings

I read your “What help do I want from Sasha…” page plus your two Substack posts from Ship It Week, and I skimmed a bunch of Sasha’s pieces you linked. Here’s the short of it, then a concrete plan.

## **What I’m seeing (super quick read)**

- You’ve already ==proven flow== + output: 40 YouTube videos in ~3 months, 400+ subs, a 7.7k-view video with a lively comment thread; you enjoy being on camera. 
- You want to make YouTube + Substack (+ maybe songs), have ~6 months runway, and you’re asking Sasha for targeted, opinionated guidance. 
- Your current Substack cadence leans “==expressive mode==” (alive, first-drafty, friend-coded), and you’ve already intuited the need to publish only the “essential” and write more for non-friends. 
- You have ==clear themes== (trauma → agency → kenshō; creative practice; modern life upgrades) and a good self-diagnosis: ==title-last, topic-drift, low cohesion==. 
- Sasha’s writing patterns you admire: strong POV posts that reframe (“10x happiness…”, “Notes against…”), vivid “type of guy” portraits, and practical metaphysics (void intimacy). These are useful north stars.

---

## **Your next 30 days (do this first)**

1. **Pick a simple weekly cadence you can actually keep for 6 weeks**
    - **Mon:** ==1 “essential” Substack essay== (reader-first; 900–1,500 words).
    - **Thu:** ==1 YouTube anchor== (6–8 min) that _embodies_ the essay (not a read-through).
    - **Fri:** ==1 vignette== (short, poetic, totally for you)—but only if the Mon essay shipped.
- This blends your joy (vignettes/video) with audience gravity (one useful essay/week). Your own doc points to “consistency” as Phase 2—let’s actually operationalize it. 
    
1. **Adopt the “Essential Only” filter you proposed**
    - Before you draft: ==write the **promise sentence**== (what a stranger gets). 
    - If you can’t write a crisp promise, it’s not essential yet. 
    - You already guessed this move; I’m just making it non-negotiable. 
    
2. **Title-first, outline-first**
    - Your problem isn’t ideas; it’s cohesion. Start with a ==compelling, specific title== and a 5-bullet outline that delivers your promise. You named this as a likely fix—lock it in. 
    
3. **Refactor one existing post into a reader-magnet**
    - Take **“Becoming angry”** (currently expressive + scattered) and turn it into:
    - **New title:** “How I Turned Restless Anger into Creative Fuel (A 10-Minute Protocol)”
		- <span class="text-red">As always, ChatGPT writes the most hideous LinkedIn slop when it comes to "creativity" - but the object-level advice is good</span>
    - **Outline:** a) why anger ≠ enemy, b) the 10-minute body drill you actually used this week, c) how it changed your writing session, d) pitfalls, e) one invitation.
    - **Keep** one or two raw paragraphs (your voice) as texture.
    - This respects the alive core while delivering value to non-friends, which you’ve already flagged as the gap.
    
4. **Relaunch YouTube as the “hub,” but smaller**
   - ==One weekly video tied to the Monday essay.== Cold-open with the outcome (“By the end you’ll have X”), then story, then 1 concrete practice. You already planned a hub return—ship it with constraints.
   - 🤔🤔🤔 What about music too 🤔🤔🤔
	   - Maybe it's a written vignette, which is then turned into a song 😎 
    
6. **Distribution ritual (30 minutes/day, timer on)**
    
    - Thoughtful comments on 2–3 adjacent Substacks or videos (add an angle, not a promo).
    - 1–2 tweets/notes that _condense_ Monday’s idea into something quotable.
    - ==Ask 2 people privately==, “If you liked this, who else should see it?”
	- This is the boring “Holy Work” consistency that Sasha says helps 7s stop chasing novelty and actually build something.

## **60–90 day arc (how this becomes momentum)**

**Pillars (rotate weekly):**
- <span class="text-red">This is the themes that ChatGPT has pulled out from the few writings I shared. Would actually be useful to be like "here's all my writings, and this fuckin website too, what are my key themes"</span>

1. Agency & inner tech (how you got from social anxiety → camera ease; void/meditation tactics).
2. Working-class → weirdly good life** (practical systems; money, friendship, place). Tie to your family arc without getting trapped in memoir. 
3. Creative practice lab (vignette craft, 3-step editing heuristic, shipping muscles).
4. Experiments in public (Ship-It-style challenges you run for yourself + readers). 

- KPIs (weekly): 
	- *feels like it's kinda chatting shit here*
	- 1 essential post; 
	- 1 video; 
	- 1,000+ words drafted; 
	- 2 external comments/day; 
	- 5 email replies solicited (“What part helped most?”). 
	- Monetization later—first grow trust.
- **Monetization sniff test (month 3):** 
	- <span class="text-red">this feels icky to think about right now</span>
	- consider a light “supporter” tier only if you’ve hit 6–8 consecutive essential posts and you’re getting unsolicited “this helped me do X” replies (Sasha’s “10x happiness” point: more happiness → more capacity; translate that to reader outcomes before paywalls). 

---

## **Make Sasha’s life easy (send him 6 laser-specific questions)**
- <span class="text-red">Not listening to any of this - all gross af</span>
- He said he’ll answer specifics. Copy/paste a tight note like this:

1. “Of your post archetypes, which 2 would you double-down on _early_ for Substack growth—and why? (e.g., reframes like ‘10x happiness’, ‘Notes Against…’, or vivid ‘type-of-guy’ portraits?)”
2. “Looking at _this outline_ for ‘How I Turned Restless Anger into Creative Fuel’, what would you cut/add to make it essential?” 
3. “From 0→5k and 5k→25k subs, what were your 1–2 most effective distribution habits (not hacks)?” 
4. “How do you personally decide when a draft is ‘essential enough’ to publish?” 
5. “Any red-flags in my proposed weekly cadence (1 essay, 1 video, 1 vignette) you’d change?”

This respects his boundaries and invites short, opinionated answers. 

---

## **Two quick craft checklists you can use today**


**The “Essential Essay” checklist (print this):**
- Title makes a promise to a stranger. 
- 1–2 core ideas, not 7.
- Concrete practice or takeaway.
- 1 vivid personal moment for texture (not the whole thing). 
- Cut 20% of sentences; front-load the value.
- End with “If you try this, tell me what changed.”

**The “7-proof workflow” (to stay out of novelty chasing):**
- 5 minutes of “void sit” → outline → draft → break → edit → ship. 
- Novelty (music/tweets/extra ideas) _after_ ship.

---

## **One note on big life changes**

Sasha’s “blow it up” essay is pro-change, but also notes the ~6-month stabilization window. You’re already on “Death Ground” with 6 months of runway—so for this window, keep your _environment stable_ and blow up your _process_ (cadence, editing, distribution) instead. Then reassess at Day 90. 

---

## **If you want a fast start this week**

- **Refactor “Becoming angry”** into the protocol piece and publish Monday. 
- **Record a 6–8 min companion video** Thursday demonstrating the protocol (show, don’t tell). 
- **Draft next Monday’s “essential” now**, title-first.
- **Send the 6-question note to Sasha** with your outline attached. 

You’ve already got the spark and the engine. This plan just puts bumpers on the lane so the ball keeps knocking pins over—week after week.
