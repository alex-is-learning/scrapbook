# Computer version (clean protocol)

- **Target:** ~750–900 words _or_ 20–30 minutes.
- **Setup:** Full-screen plain text, no formatting; **turn off** spellcheck/grammar; notifications off.
- **Rule:** Keep typing—**no backspace** except to fix the current word; typos stay.
- **If stuck:** Type “I don’t know what to write” until words return.
- **Privacy:** Save to a dated file/folder; don’t reread for ~8 weeks; don’t publish.
- **Finish:** Stop at the timer/word count—no polishing.

That’s it: dump, don’t judge, done.
