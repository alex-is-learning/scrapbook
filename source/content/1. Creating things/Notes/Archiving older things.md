- I'm wondering if I could clean up my digital footprint
- Era 1 of making things involved publishing a lot of first drafts and being really happy to be making things
- I'm happy I did this, but it does leave me with a lot of kinda shitty things
- I'd quite like to only have like... "essential" things uploaded, rather than everything
- There's been something in me of like "I want to keep everything published so that people can see the journey/progression!", but I think it might be better to just tell the story of the journey/progression in a compelling way one day, rather than leaving all these messy breadcrumbs everywhere
