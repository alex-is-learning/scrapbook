- [[Writing more! (Parent page)]]

- 2025-09-14 - I've been enjoying writing [[Writing - vignettes|vignettes]], but they feel kind of constraining, too, like, I don't want to dilute the good ones with shitty ones, so it puts pressure on the next one, like, the next one must be good
- I want a place to just write 
- But there's something in me which is like "if it's not public-facing then it's not real"
- So, lemme try writing super zero pressure stuff here instead
