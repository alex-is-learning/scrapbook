- I'm so torn about this film! 
	- On the one hand, it's pretty great, and it was my entry point into DFW
	- On the other hand - they made a biopic about DFW, without the permission of his estate, his widow, his parents. I think he'd be deeply horrified to know that it was made.
		- It's also jarring to see someone play DFW, and to do it in a very intense like "I am going to kill myself, don't you see!" kind of way
- There's [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/29/why-the-end-of-the-tour-isnt-really-about-my-friend-david-foster-wallace) about it:
