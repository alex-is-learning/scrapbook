- [[Archiving older things]]

Hello from Toronto! I love it here!

Just a real quick post that I’ve now gone from 0 to 1 consensus-ism coaching sessions and it’s really unlocked the “oh shit I actually can explain this to people and be useful” thing, which is awesome!

I’m procrastinating _hard_ on writing more posts (well actually I just don’t have consensus to write them, hehe), but I have been putting a bunch of hours into refining my understanding via my insane visual note Miro board and feel like I’m in a good place to explain this in a 1:1 way, even if trying to clarify it all in writing still feels somewhat daunting

(Here’s one section of my Miro board)

(And here’s the whole thing zoomed out, just to show you how insane I am)

So, if you’d be interested in having a free exploratory call, and potentially a regular paid engagement, email me at alexiscreatingthings@gmail.com, or grab a meeting time via [this link](https://calendly.com/alexanderklarge/coaching) :)

My obsession with Scott Pilgrim which I developed at the age of 15 is very much alive and well 12 years later — I’ve been having so much fun visiting various sites where they filmed/that appear in the graphic novels → I’m writing this from the reference library hehehehe
