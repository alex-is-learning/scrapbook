- [[Archiving older things]]

Hello! So I started this blog (and tweeting way more) after my silent meditation retreat, when I noticed that I had a big need to express myself more, to have more self-authorship, more creative expression, etc.

And, after writing a few substacks, and tweeting a bunch, I now feel… completely fulfilled in this area!

I actually set up “self expression & authorship” as an Intend.do goal (I’m absolutely obsessed with Intend btw, it’s a fantastic tool to help with consensus-ism and non-self-coercion), and these days the only daily thing to do for the goal is tweet.

All this to say - I’m counting the fact that I don’t write on here anymore to be a win - I’m following my consensus and noticing that I have no need to express myself anymore, because I’m doing it a bunch on twitter. Yay!

So I guess I’m just quickly writing this to close the loop for myself. See you on Twitter! [https://twitter.com/alexislearning](https://twitter.com/alexislearning)
