- [[Archiving older things]]

I still haven’t got my frickin Twitter account back (!!!) so thought I’d do a quick post here instead:

I’ve been in an interesting “what do I make my life about now that I’ve reached the end of my ‘ahhh I have social anxiety and feel bad about myself and priority #1 is figuring out how to fix that’” arc, and what I’ve landed on right now is **“find creative outlets and be publicly bad at creating stuff for a while whilst honing various skills”.**

So as of ~2 weeks ago I’ve been publishing pretty much >1 video a day, lmao. Turns out I’ve always wanted a creative outlet and have had a backlog of energy??

A few videos:

- [Ranking the 23 songs I made in 23 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGNxfy_3RVI) → dude I’ve been so surprised that >250 people have watched this despite it being long. I’m actually legit proud of some of these songs - I’d never made music before!
    
- [The song “Viceroy” by Mac DeMarco but he loves rice cakes instead of cigarettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pddX706L648) (can’t believe I was the first person to do this)
    
- [A vlog about reading my first ever Harry Potter fan fiction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZiknRsNvX0&ab_channel=AlexisLearning) - fun to chat shit about what I’m currently excited about

It’s been super fun and interesting so far - I’m currently in the “hm ok that was a fun 2 weeks but I feel like I’m plateauing and need to up my skill level in a few things” micro-era, so we’ll see what comes next…

And also thinking that maybe working at a cafe part time and being “creative” for a year could be the move - having a non-screen-based job so that I can be in front of a screen during “creative time”, plus have a job that isn’t cerebral and kinda draining but instead sociable and tangible…

Idk, it’s a weird era for me, but I’m liking it!

Peace & love

Alex xoxo
