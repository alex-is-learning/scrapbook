# Misc other things:

To have never been to a gym, or tracked your macros, or learned how to use a computer well. To operate as if Google Maps and Google Translate do not exist.

Will my kids who are 3-4 generations ahead of me, feel the same way about me? Or is to be raised with the internet and have the growth mindset part of your brain switch on, mean I'll keep up to date? Or will I be morally opposed to the new changes? 

To have never owned [tech]. To have never stretched. To have never done yoga. To have never meditated. To have never done a drug other than alcohol, perhaps weed.

## tech (this is more like thinking than writing now?)

To be a boomer is to buy a budget smartphone, a shitty tablet, to have a desktop computer from 10 years ago. To only have high-friction experiences with technology - to not realise how good using a computer can be 

To be a zoomer - I remember being a kid, with Windows XP, learning how to play this Star Wars X-Wing game by just pressing all the buttons. Exploring Windows, poking around in the control panel, seeing what it can do. 

Why not just learn by poking around? My grandma (entirely different generation, silent generation?) was *totally* mystified by the computer, truly could not get her head around even the basics - even a TV was essentially too much for her. It makes me worry - will I be like that when I'm 50/60/70? Or are these generations who spent the formative years of their life with no significant new technologies, no significant new *learning curves* - because of course, they'll have seen the advent of TV and radio and etc, but nothing on the scale of computers where you learn new tools and download new things and etc. I hope that I was trained to be agentic young enough that I won't infuriate my kids. Or at least, if I do, it'll be from choice ("I'm morally opposed to x new technology, and I've thought about it carefully"), rather than ignorance or fear.
