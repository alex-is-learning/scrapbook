So yesterday ([[Day 2 - bottom up learning - America & Immigration]]) I just did bottom-up learning, so today I'll get back on the "poking around twitter" vibe. 

First tweet I saw:

# 1. AOC re: Andrew Cuomo
![[Pasted image 20250613171403.png]]
[Link](https://x.com/AOC/status/1933319082746786074)

- Ok so, as an English guy who doesn't really follow the news, this is very juicy, because idk wtf is going on here
## My initial model of what this all means
### 1a. I guess Andrew Cuomo is now the head (or at least the frontrunner) for either the Republicans or Democrats in New York?
- So I guess Andrew Cuomo was recently elected to be the head of NYC? So presumably he's the head of New York state - I'm 99% sure this is called the "Governor" (in the UK we just have MPs, members of Parliament, at a county level)
- Also, if he's running, then what's he been up to until this point? Is he already the Governor and he's running again? 
	- What was Rudy Guliani - the Mayor, right? I'm like 95% sure that's correct, and that he's no longer the Mayor
### 1b. How do State-level elections work?
- Thing I don't know - how often do states have elections? Are state elections all synced up across the US, or do they happen at kinda random-ass times? Is it like, you get 4 years as the Governor, like the President? Are there term limits? 
### 1c. Is Cuomo a Republican or a Democrat?
- If I had to guess, I'd say he's a Democrat
	- AOC is more likely to be like "wtf, my party are letting me down here", vs "can't believe the Republicans stand behind this guy"
	- New York is, presumably, very Democrat-leaning? Like, it's metropolitan, the kind of "liberal elite" vibes? California and NYC are probably both Democrat strongholds?
		- But then again, there are lots of like... bankers, business people and shit. But I would assume there's a huge lower-and-middle-class which drowns out the rich folks
		- Vs e.g. the Midwest is Republican-leaning?
### 1d. What scandals?
- I'm assuming he's running for governor. What scandals might a probably Democrat guy he wracked with? 
	- Money stuff - taking money from dubious sources. Super PACs
	- Could he be the guy who was texting minors?? Or was that Matt Gaetz (sp)? I think it was Matt Gaetz, feel like I heard about that via SNL
	- AOC said anti-corruption, so I think it's probably yeah, money stuff. 
- What money stuff would constitute a scandal? 
	- I've heard about governors and members of Congress (which I know barely anything about atm) have done stuff like insider training, also taking money from lobbying groups that are considered immoral, idk what else
- What other scandals are common?
	- Money stuff, cheating on spouses... idk what the third would be... I truly can't think of a third thing lol, wtf
### 1e. Why would they choose to back him despite the scandals?
- Well he must be the most viable candidate... he's probably got lots of experience, and credentials, and the scandals haven't affected him enough to make jumping ship worth it
### 1f. What does "lining up behind" a candidate mean?
- Is it like... agreeing with that person that you're on their side, that you'll... signal boost them? Publicly endorse them? 
## Predictions
1. Andrew Cuomo is a member of the Democratic party - 70% sure
2. Andrew Cuomo is currently the Governor of the state of New York - 40%
3. Andrew Cuomo is running for reelection - 40%
4. The election cycles for States happen at different times - states don't sync up so everyone across the US votes for new governors at the same time. It happens kinda randomly - 60%
5. Rudy Guiliani was the Mayor of New York - 99%
6. Rudy Guiliani is no longer the mayor of New York - 100%
7. State governors are reelected every 4 years (?) - 20%
8. There are term limits for state governors - 60%
9. New York is historically a Democrat-led state - 75%
10. Cuomo's scandals are primarily re: money stuff, specifically taking funds from dubious places - 40%
	1. Feels likely that I'm missing something here. My model of "political scandals" feels very weak. But then again, I've vaguely followed the news for a while, so you'd think if "money" and "affairs" are the only things are top of mind... ok, I'm gonna go 60%
11. Matt Gaetz was the one who was texting minors (at least 1 minor, idk if it was multiple) - 70%
12. If I ask ChatGPT what the 2 most common scandal types are for Governors, it'll be money stuff, and marital infidelity - 55%
13. Cuomo is backed by the establishment because he is seen as the most viable candidate - 80%
14. Cuomo's top competitors are relative unknowns and therefore the establishment doesn't want to get behind them - 70%
## Put them in Fatebook so I get to update my calibration score
![[Pasted image 20250613175257.png]]

## Updates

1. Andrew Cuomo is a member of the Democratic party - 70% sure
	- ✅ TRUE
2. Andrew Cuomo is currently the Governor of the state of New York - 40%
	1. ❌ FALSE 
	2. He was the Governor, he resigned, now he's running for Mayor 
3. Andrew Cuomo is running for reelection - 40%
	1. ❌ FALSE 
	2. I was right to do <50%, he is kind of running for reelection (to a leadership position), but he's never been mayor before
4. The election cycles for States happen at different times - states don't sync up so everyone across the US votes for new governors at the same time. It happens kinda randomly - 60% 
	1. ✅  TRUE 
	2. I'm gonna say this was right, although it's imprecise. ChatGPT says that most states do it during mid-terms, but some don't. I could have been more precise by saying "not all states run elections at the same time"
5. Rudy Guiliani was the Mayor of New York - 99%
	1. ✅ TRUE
6. Rudy Guiliani is no longer the mayor of New York - 100%
	1. ✅ TRUE
7. State governors are reelected every 4 years (?) - 20% 
	1. FALSE ❌ 
	2. I was right! They mostly are, but some states reelect every 2 years.
	3. I should have been more precise by saying "*all* governors are reelected every 4 years" (20%)
8. There are term limits for state governors - 60% 
	1. FALSE ❌
	2. I should have written "all states have term limits", as that's what I was getting at 
	3. Turns out some states don't have term limits. Most do though
9. New York is historically a Democrat-led state - 75%
	- ✅ TRUE
10. Cuomo's scandals are primarily re: money stuff, specifically taking funds from dubious places - 40%
	- ❌ FALSE - ChatGPT says his #1 scandal is re: sexual harrassment
11. Matt Gaetz was the one who was texting minors (at least 1 minor, idk if it was multiple) - 70%
	- ✅ TRUE
12. If I ask ChatGPT what the 2 most common scandal types are for Governors, it'll be money stuff, and marital infidelity - 55%
	- ✅ TRUE
13. Cuomo is backed by the establishment because he is seen as the most viable candidate - 80%
	- ✅ TRUE, although this is a kind of lame prediction
	- Turns out he's seen as more moderate, I could have guessed something like that
14. Cuomo's top competitors are relative unknowns and therefore the establishment doesn't want to get behind them - 70%
	- ❌ FALSE - because he's running for Mayor (not Governor, as I thought) - he's running against the current Mayor, who isn't a relative unknown, because he's you know, the Mayor of New York City, lol
# This was a little tedious to do
- I wonder about this - writing it down ahead of time felt useful to extract maximum questions from the tweet, but then porting to Fateboot and then porting my answers back to here feels a little clunky...
- Useful though! So much juice in one tweet!
- I also have a sense that this was too much. I feel like I had too many predictions, and it doesn't feel super salient. Vs if I really zeroed in on trying to richly model one specific facet...
